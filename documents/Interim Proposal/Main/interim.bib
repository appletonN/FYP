  abstract = {Light has a profound influence on human physiology and behaviour, most notably permitting visual perception. However, light information serves a parallel set of functions in biology that are essential for our health and wellbeing, including the synchronisation of our circadian clock to the solar day. The circadian clock drives endogenous daily rhythms across human physiology and behaviour. However, when the circadian clock is not appropriately aligned with external time, disturbances in sleep/wake behaviours, alertness, mood and performance arise. Here, the important question of how blindness \textemdash{} a loss of visual perception \textemdash{} impacts the circadian clock's synchronisation with the solar day is discussed. This review will explore how and why vision loss can cause significant disruptions in behaviour and physiology that go beyond the loss of conscious visual perception, and why blindness is not as closely linked with deficits in photoentrainment as we might expect.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Descartes intuitively anticipated the so-called `binding problem' of consciousness and thought that the pineal gland enables spatio-temporal integration in cognitive processing. Recent findings indicate that a major role in the process of temporal integration and binding involve neurons in suprachiasmatic nuclei, specifically targeting the pineal gland and other structures, and control the neuroendocrine rhythms. Melatonin is an endocrine output signal of the clock and provides circadian information as an endogenous synchronizer which stabilizes and reinforces circadian rhythms. This integrative process occurs at the different levels of the circadian network via gene expression in some brain regions and peripheral structures that enables integration of circadian, hormonal, and metabolic information and creating temporal order of bodily and mental experience. This specific temporal order is reflected in associative sequentiality that is necessary for cognition, behavior and all processes of memory consolidation that must preserve all information in the temporal causal order and synchrony. In this context, recent findings suggest that melatonin could be a potential regulator in the processes that contribute to memory formation, long-term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and other brain regions. There is evidence that stress disrupts normal activity and memory consolidation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this process leads to memories that are stored without a contextual or spatiotemporal frame. These findings emphasize a specific role of melatonin in mechanisms of consciousness, memory and stress and are also consistent with reported studies that indicate melatonin alterations under stressful conditions and in mental disorders.},

Likewise, appreciation the physiological roles of melatonin has increased dramatically with the cloning and targeted knockout of melatonin receptors. With these molecular tools in hand, we can now address more specific questions about how and why melatonin is made in the pineal at night and about how it influences the rest of the body.},

Lighting enables us to see but lighting conditions that cause visual discomfort are likely to lead to eyestrain. Anyone who frequently experiences eyestrain is not enjoying the best of health. The lighting conditions that cause visual discomfort in buildings are well known and easily avoided. The third is light operating through the circadian system. This is known to influence sleep patterns and believed to be linked to the development of breast cancer among night shift workers., There is still much to learn about the impact of light on human health but what is known is enough to ensure that the topic requires the attention of all those concerned with the lighting of buildings.},

The numerical specification of colors, using the Commission internationale de l'\'eclairage (CIE) system of colorimetry, requires a spectral power distribution for the light source, reflectance or transmittance data in the visible region for the object, and defined numerical descriptions for the color responses of the observer. These data allow calculation of the three tristimulus values (X, Y, and Z), defining the color of the object, and these coordinates locate the position of the color in a 3-D color space. The difference in color between two objects is related to the distance between their respective points in the color space. The initially calculated tristimulus values are usually transformed into other coordinate systems, for example, the CIELAB system, to provide a more visually uniform color space in which the perceived difference in color of two objects corresponds closely to the separation of their points in the color space. Colorimetry has become a standard industrial technique for quality control and for colorant recipe formulation and modification.},

This signal affects a broad array of physiological and behavioral processes, making a generalized hypothesis for melatonin function an elusive objective. Still, there are some common features of melatonin function. First, melatonin biosynthesis is always associated with photoreceptors and/or cells that are embryonically derived from photoreceptors. Second, melatonin frequently affects the perception of the photic environment and has as its site of action structures involved in vision. Finally, melatonin affects overt circadian function at least partially via regulation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or its hofnologues. The mechanisms by which melatonin affects circadian rhythms and other downstream processes are unknown, but they include interaction with a class of membrane-bound receptors that affect intracellular processes through guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein second messenger systems. Investigation of mechanisms by which melatonin affects its target tissues may unveil basic concepts of neuromodulation, visual system function, and the circadian clock.},

The first assesses the adequacy of illumination for an activity in terms of the density of reflected light from surrounding room surfaces and the second is concerned with how the luminaire luminous flux is directed onto selected target surfaces. Taken together, these criteria offer a quite new approach for designing lighting installations for general practice.},

Yet the demonstration of an intensity-dependent neuroendocrine response to bright light has led to renewed consideration of light as a possible synchronizer of the human circadian pacemaker. In a laboratory study, the output of the circadian pacemaker of an elderly woman was monitored before and after exposure to 4 hours of bright light for seven consecutive evenings, and before and after a control study in ordinary room light while her sleep-wake schedule and social contacts remained unchanged. The exposure to bright light in the evening induced a 6-hour delay shift of her circadian pacemaker, as indicated by recordings of body temperature and cortisol secretion. The unexpected magnitude, rapidity, and stability of the shift challenge existing concepts regarding circadian phase-resetting capacity in man and suggest that exposure to bright light can indeed reset the human circadian pacemaker, which controls daily variations in physiologic, behavioral, and cognitive function.},

We report new studies in which we tested the efficacy of LD cycles in entraining the circadian rhythms of human subjects living in isolation from environmental time cues. We found that the cyclic alternation of light and dark, when applied to human subjects in a comparable way to experiments in other species, was an effective entraining agent. Our results and a critical review of the literature indicate that a LD cycle alone can be an effective environmental synchronizer of the human circadian timing system. Other factors, such as the knowledge of time of day, social contacts, the feeding schedule, and the imposed rest-activity schedule may contribute to stable entrainment, although their relative strengths as synchronizers have yet to be determined.},

Like the photoreceptors of image-forming systems, the pigments contained within non-visual photoreceptive cells comprise a protein component (opsin) linked to a light-sensitive retinal chromophore derived from vitamin A. In mammals, one of the most important of these non-visual pigments is melanopsin (encoded by the OPN4 gene, specifically that of the ``mammal-like'' or ``m-class''), which is restricted in expression to a subset of retinal ganglion cells and has been shown to be the conduit through which light regulates many physiological activities, including the photoentrainment of circadian systems (e.g. the sleep cycle) and the pupillary reflex response. In non-mammals, melanopsin exists as two distinct gene lineages, namely the m-class and x-class (``Xenopus-like''), and both are expressed in many different tissues, including the eyes, skin, fins, gills, brain and pineal gland; however, the functional roles mediated by melanopsin in these ``lower'' vertebrates remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we discuss the evolutionary history of the melanopsin gene, its diverse patterns of expression and transcriptional output, the functional roles so far determined, and the clinical significance of this critical and phylogenetically most ancient opsin-based system of irradiance detection.},

Despite the increasing interest among scientists in fields such as ecology, astronomy, health care, and land-use planning, light pollution lacks a current quantification of its magnitude on a global scale. To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new high-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements. This atlas shows that more than 80\% of the world and more than 99\% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60\% of Europeans and nearly 80\% of North Americans. Moreover, 23\% of the world's land surfaces between 75\textdegree N and 60\textdegree S, 88\% of Europe, and almost half of the United States experience light-polluted nights. The world atlas of zenith artificial night sky brightness is modelled with VIIRS DNB data and calibrated with more than 35,000 observations.

  abstract = {A model of circadian phototransduction was published in 2005 to predict the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system to narrow-band and polychromatic light sources by combining responses to light from the spectral-opponent ``blue'' versus ``yellow'' cone bipolar pathway with direct responses to light by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. In the model, depolarizing ``blue'' responses, but not hyperpolarizing ``yellow'' responses, from the ``blue'' versus ``yellow'' pathway are combined with the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell responses. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell neurons are known to be much slower to respond to light than the cone pathway, so an implication of the model is that periodic flashes of ``blue'' light, but not ``yellow'' light, would be effective for stimulating the circadian system. A within-subjects study was designed to test the implications of the model regarding retinal exposures to brief flashes of light. The study was also aimed at broadening the foundation for clinical treatment of circadian sleep disorders by delivering flashing light through closed eyelids while people were asleep. In addition to a dark control night, the eyelids of 16 subjects were exposed to three light-stimulus conditions in the phase delay portion of the phase response curve while they were asleep: (1) 2-second flashes of 111 W/m2 of blue ({$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 480 nm) light once every minute for 1 hour, (2) 131 W/m2 of green ({$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 527 nm) light, continuously on for 1 hour, and (3) 2-second flashes of the same green light once every minute for 1 hour. Inferential statistics showed that the blue flash light-stimulus condition significantly delayed circadian phase and significantly suppressed nocturnal melatonin. The results of this study further our basic understanding of circadian phototransduction and broaden the technical foundations for delivering light through closed eyelids during sleep for treating circadian sleep disorders.},

This increase after awakening, a phenomenon termed the cortisol awakening response (CAR), appears to be a distinct feature of the hypothalamus\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal (HPA) axis, superimposing the circadian rhythmicity of cortisol secretion. Several studies point towards an important role of the hippocampus and, additionally, other brain structures (e. g. amygdala, prefrontal cortex, suprachiasmatic nucleus) in the regulation of the CAR. There is increasing knowledge that the CAR is influenced by a variety of factors such as gender, health status, and health behavior or stress perception. However, the exact function of the profound cortisol increase after awakening is still not clarified. We hypothesize that the anticipation of the upcoming day is of major relevance for the magnitude of the CAR. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the neural regulation of the CAR and factors influencing this phenomenon and considerations are addressed concerning the exact function of the CAR.},

  abstract = {Numbers of animal species react to the natural phenomenon of fire, but only humans have learnt to control it and to make it at will. Natural fires caused overwhelmingly by lightning are highly evident on many landscapes. Birds such as hawks, and some other predators, are alert to opportunities to catch animals including invertebrates disturbed by such fires and similar benefits are likely to underlie the first human involvements with fires. Early hominins would undoubtedly have been aware of such fires, as are savanna chimpanzees in the present. Rather than as an event, the discovery of fire use may be seen as a set of processes happening over the long term. Eventually, fire became embedded in human behaviour, so that it is involved in almost all advanced technologies. Fire has also influenced human biology, assisting in providing the high-quality diet which has fuelled the increase in brain size through the Pleistocene. Direct evidence of early fire in archaeology remains rare, but from 1.5 Ma onward surprising numbers of sites preserve some evidence of burnt material. By the Middle Pleistocene, recognizable hearths demonstrate a social and economic focus on many sites. The evidence of archaeological sites has to be evaluated against postulates of biological models such as the `cooking hypothesis' or the `social brain', and questions of social cooperation and the origins of language. Although much remains to be worked out, it is plain that fire control has had a major impact in the course of human evolution.This article is part of the themed issue `The interaction of fire and mankind'.},

Interest has been stimulated by new archaeological finds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and also by major inputs from other disciplines, including primatology and evolutionary psychology. Evidence for fire is, however, often disputed, especially with regard to the early cases in Africa. Interpretations often struggle to take into account the implications of a huge bias in archaeological preservation, which means that our surviving evidence does not accurately map the past. Additionally, there is often a `yes-no' presence/absence approach to fire, which does not recognise that earliest hominin fire use may have occurred in interaction with natural fire, and may not even have included deliberate hearth use in its first stages. Here we examine the need to integrate different approaches to the issues of early fire-use, considering especially the earliest archaeological evidence and the `cooking hypothesis', while also tackling the issues of apparent differences in early African and European fire records.},

These rhythms are predominantly driven by endogenous clocks with a periodicity approximating to one day, i.e. circadian. In mammals, the circadian clock governing activity/ rest, neuroendocrine and autonomic rhythms lies in the hypothalamus, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Intrinsic circadian oscillators are also present in the retina. The SCN ``clockwork'' is based on a cell autonomous, genetically determined mechanism. Mammalian homologues of a number of Drosophila genes which encode elements of the fly circadian mechanism have recently been identified. In Drosophila, the protein products of these genes interact in a negative feedback loop, establishing a circadian cycle in gene expression. Characterisation of the roles played by putative mammalian clock genes in the SCN, and how the emergent cellular signal imposes order over the entire neuraxis, will provide a fundamental contribution to our understanding of the molecular basis of behaviour.

Twenty-four volunteers were each tested over the course of five consecutive days, including a practice session and four test sessions, one for each of the lighting conditions. Volunteers showed highest visual acuity as measured on symbol identification and color recognition tasks with LED relative to fluorescent lighting and this effect was greatest at highest color temperatures. In terms of psychological and cognitive performance, volunteers showed increased fatigue ratings with fluorescent relative to LED, and this effect was associated with slower response times on tasks measuring spatial and verbal memory. Relevance to industry Recent increases in the number of LED technologies being incorporated into industrial lighting applications carry implications for worker performance. We provide evidence that these advanced lighting technologies can promote increased alertness and visual cognitive efficiency among workers when compared to more traditional alternatives.},

Actually lighting already consumes about 20 \% of the world wide produced electrical power. Solid state lighting (SSL) can reduce the consumption significantly by up to 66 \%. LEDs, as the main fraction in SSL, can theoretically convert the electrical energy by 100 \% to visible light. This paper introduces common lighting solutions and points out challenges for LED packaging. A detailed discussion will be done on heat dissipation, which is a significant factor regarding efficiency as well as life time. Standard and forward-looking materials and techniques will be introduced. Finally, the environmental impact of the SSL modules will be discussed. Even if the LEDs are more efficient than fluorescent lamps and need by total weight less material than incandescent lamps, the used materials are noble and rare, so a critical validation of their use is needed.},

Therefore, blocking blue light could create a form of physiologic darkness. Because the timing and quantity of light and darkness both affect sleep, evening use of amber lenses to block blue light might affect sleep quality. Mood is also affected by light and sleep; therefore, mood might be affected by blue light blockade. In this study, 20 adult volunteers were randomized to wear either blue-blocking (amber) or yellow-tinted (blocking ultraviolet only) safety glasses for 3 h prior to sleep. Participants completed sleep diaries during a one-week baseline assessment and two weeks' use of glasses. Outcome measures were subjective: change in overall sleep quality and positive/negative affect. Results demonstrated that sleep quality at study outset was poorer in the amber lens than the control group. Two- by three-way ANOVA revealed significant (p {$<$} .001) interaction between quality of sleep over the three weeks and experimental condition. At the end of the study, the amber lens group experienced significant (p {$<$} .001) improvement in sleep quality relative to the control group and positive affect (p = .005).

  abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey ( n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

His lectures on science made the fortunes of the Royal Institution in London, and he taught chemistry to the young Faraday.

Methods Studies that specifically included information on nightshift or shift work and reported cancer occurrence were focused upon. A systematic search of Medline and the Science Citation Index was conducted until May 2007. The quality of each paper was discussed with respect to design, exposure and outcome information, bias, confounding, and exposure-response assessment. Results Thirteen relevant reports were found, and eight reported the relative risk for breast cancer, three for prostate cancer, three for colon cancer, and four for all cancers. Most of the studies had crude information about nightshift work, four register-linked studies had no individual exposure information but relied on exposure probabilities assessed on a group level, and no studies analyzed cancer risk according to the cumulative number of night shifts (however, most of the studies did so according to the number of years of nightshift work). Confounding did not seem to be of major concern. The presentation of the results was not always complete, and it would have been appreciated if the reasons for leaving some findings out had been reported. There were indications of a long-term effect of nightshift work (more than 20-30 years), but the number of positive studies was small. In addition, they were all conducted among nurses, and the risk estimates were only moderately increased. This situation makes the results sensitive to bias, chance, and confounding. Conclusions There is limited evidence for a causal association between nightshift work and breast cancer, while there is insufficient evidence for prostate cancer, colon cancer, and overall cancer.},

While, blue LED light damaged the primary retinal cells and the damage was photoreceptor specific. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, protected against the cellular damage induced by blue LED light. Overall, the LED light induced cell damage was wavelength-, but not energy-dependent and may cause more severe retinal photoreceptor cell damage than the other LED light.},

In the second night the subjects were exposed to light of 500 lux for 60 min during the rising phase of melatonin synthesis. The third series of samples was collected during the third night. The mean decrease of melatonin levels by the exposure to light was 56\% of the prelight concentrations. The melatonin onset times were delayed significantly (about 30 min) the night after the exposure to light. The melatonin offset times tended to be delayed in experiment 2. The shifts of the melatonin offset correlated positively with the amount of the melatonin suppression. The results suggest that a relatively small and short lasting light-induced interruption of melatonin synthesis may affect the melatonin rhythm in humans.},

It protects the eye from the exposure to various light sources that significantly emit in blue spectrum. However, the impact of blue light on the ocular surface has been poorly explored so far. In this study, we investigated in vitro the phototoxicity of blue light illumination in human epithelial cells of the ocular surface. We worked either in basal conditions or under hyperosmolar stress, in order to mimic dry eye disease (DED) that is the most common disease involving the ocular surface. Results Corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells suffered the most from violet-blue light but also from longer-wave blue light. Exposure to blue wavebands significantly decreased cellular viability, impacted on cellular morphology and provoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-production. Conjunctival epithelial cell line had a greater photosensitivity than the corneal epithelial one. Hyperosmolar stress potentiated the blue light phototoxicity, increasing inflammation, altering mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggering the glutathione-based antioxidant system. Innovation In human epithelial corneal and conjunctival cells of the ocular surface, we demonstrated the harmful impact of blue light on viability, redox state and inflammation processes, which was modified by hyperosmolarity. Conclusion Blue light induced cell death and significant ROS production, and altered the expression of inflammatory genes and operation of the cellular defensive system. We established for the first time that hyperosmolar stress impacted phototoxicity, further suggesting that DED patients might be more sensitive to blue light ocular toxicity.},

  abstract = {Students who work during the school year face the potential of sleep deprivation and its effects, since they have to juggle between school and work responsibilities along with social life. This may leave them with less time left for sleep than their nonworking counterparts. Chronotype is a factor that may exert an influence on the sleep of student workers. Also, light and social zeitgebers may have an impact on the sleep-related problems of this population. This study aimed to document sleep, light exposure patterns, social rhythms, and work-related fatigue of student workers aged 19\textendash 21 yrs and explore possible associations with chronotype. A total of 88 student workers (mean {$\pm$} SD: 20.18 {$\pm$} .44 yrs of age; 36 males/52 females) wore an actigraph (Actiwatch-L; Mini-Mitter/Respironics,Bend, OR) and filled out the Social Rhythm Metric for two consecutive weeks during the school year. Also, they completed the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion/Recovery Scale (OFER). Repeated and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), Pearson's chi-square tests, and correlation coefficients were used for statistical comparisons. Subjects slept an average of 06:28 h/night. Actigraphic sleep parameters, such as sleep duration, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep latency, did not differ between chronotypes. Results also show that evening types (n = 17) presented lower subjective sleep quality than intermediate types (n = 58) and morning types (n = 13). Moreover, evening types reported higher levels of chronic work-related fatigue, exhibited less regular social rhythms, and were exposed to lower levels of light during their waking hours (between 2 and 11 h after wake time) as compared to intermediate types and morning types. In addition, exposure to light intensities between 100 and 500 lux was lower in evening types than in intermediate types and morning types. However, bright light exposure ({$\geq$}1000 lux) did not differ between chronotypes. In conclusion, results suggest that student workers may constitute a high-risk population for sleep deprivation. Evening types seemed to cope less well with sleep deprivation, reporting poorer sleep quality and higher levels of work-related fatigue than intermediate types and morning types. The higher chronic work-related fatigue of evening types may be linked to their attenuated level of light exposure and weaker social zeitgebers. These results add credence to the hypothesis that eveningness entails a higher risk of health-impairing behaviors. (Author correspondence: luc.laberge@uqac.ca)},

Using the microlevel data of Japanese households, we identify the determinants of LED adoption. We take two approaches in the empirical analysis. In the first approach, we define the adoption stage of each household based on whether LEDs are installed in different types of rooms. We then analyze the relationship between the adoption stage and household characteristics based on the ordered logit model. In the second approach, we apply the item response theory method to assess the household's ability to adopt LEDs. We then analyze the relationship between household adaptability and characteristics based on the two-sided truncation model. We find that the impacts of household characteristics on LED adoption are similar between the two approaches: low-income households do not use LEDs; household heads aged 65 to 74 are active in LED installation, although those older than 75 are less active; people living in old or rented houses do not use LEDs. Finally, we find a large variation in LED installation across prefectures.},

A common molecular mechanism underlies the cell-autonomous circadian oscillator throughout the body, yet this clock system is adapted to different functional contexts. In the central suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a coupled population of neuronal circadian oscillators acts as a master pacemaker for the organism to drive rhythms in activity and rest, feeding, body temperature, and hormones. Coupling within the SCN network confers robustness to the SCN pacemaker, which in turn provides stability to the overall temporal architecture of the organism. Throughout the majority of the cells in the body, cell-autonomous circadian clocks are intimately enmeshed within metabolic pathways. Thus, an emerging view for the adaptive significance of circadian clocks is their fundamental role in orchestrating metabolism.},

Two main lines have been raised: electricity generation with renewable energy and energy saving. The raising cost of energy makes indoor lighting techniques as one of the most important contributors for energy saving in most of the industrialized countries. Therefore, the history of indoor lighting is not exclusively linked to the development of new light sources, having impact on energy saving and sustainability. The aim of this paper was to study and analyse the evolution and milestones of indoor lighting from incandescent bulbs to the modern light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic lighting emitting diodes (OLED) going through intermediate milestones like fluorescent lamps (FL) and/or techniques in lighting induction lamps. As main conclusion of this review, it has been found that indoor lighting techniques with their energy efficiency have opened new perspectives for optimizing the energy conversion and this in turn will play a major role in people's quality of life and well-being.},

This development was prompted in the late 1980s by the invention of the blue LED, a wavelength that had previously been missing from the available LED spectrum and which opened the way to providing white light. Since that point, LED performance (including energy efficiency) has improved dramatically, and now compares with the performance of fluorescent lights - and there remain further performance improvements yet to be delivered. The book begins with the principles of LED lighting, then focuses on issues and challenges. Chapters are devoted to key steps in LED manufacturing: substrate, epitaxy, process and packaging. Photoelectric characterization of LEDs, Lighting with LEDs and the imposition of a certain level of color quality, are the subject of later chapters, and finally there is a detailed discussion of the emergence of OLEDs, or organic LEDs, which have specific capabilities of immediate interest and importance in this field.},

Exposure to blue LED light for 3 days induced retinal damage, and the characteristics of the damage differed from that induced by white fluorescent light exposure. Ophthalmoscopy showed that blue LED exposure for 3 days induced white spots on the retina, and histological examinations showed materials accumulated at the IS/OS junction of the photoreceptors. The accumulated materials were stained by ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1), a marker for macrophages. The debris was also positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). An enlarging the area of RPE was detected just after the blue LED exposure especially around the optic nerve, and this led to a secondary degeneration of the photoreceptors. Exposure of pigmented mice to 3 consecutive days of blue LED light will cause RPE and photoreceptor damage. The damage led to an accumulation of macrophages and drusen-like materials around the outer segments of the photoreceptors. This blue light exposed model may be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of non-exudative age-related macular degeneration.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Circadian rhythmicity impairment reportedly becomes significant as a tumor progresses, while the incidence of cancer can be affected by disruption of the circadian system. Melatonin has oncostatic effects on several types of cancer (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers), while it can be self-defeating in others, such as lymphoma. Melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers in humans; however, it seems to respond positively to melatonin in vitro. The present work tested whether body temperature (BT) rhythms are impaired by tumor progression, and whether exogenous melatonin restricts tumor growth and restores circadian rhythmicity; therefore, enhancing survival. To this end, C57 mice were intraperitoneal implanted with a temperature data logger and subcutaneously inoculated with melanoma cells. Animals were then submitted to light\textendash dark (LD) 12:12 cycles or continuous light (LL), with or without melatonin administration. Under LD light conditions, the BT rhythm exhibited a marked reduction in the first circadian harmonic amplitude, and increased phase instability (Rayleigh vector) as the tumor progressed. Melatonin administration (2 mg/kg BW/day), on the other hand, increased the BT rhythm amplitude and phase stability, reduced tumor weight and prevented intraperitoneal dissemination. Exposure to LL induced a free-running rhythm (1500 min), significantly increasing tumor malignity, and therefore reducing survival. Surprisingly, the highest tumor weights and morbidity by metastasis were seen in the LL group treated with melatonin probably because this indoleamine was being administered at different subjective hours to free-running animals. Circadian rhythmicity can thus be used as a marker rhythm for tumor progression, as rhythm impairment increases along with tumor malignancy. While melatonin administration improves rhythmicity and enhances survival under LD conditions, the results are self-defeating when they coexist with circadian disruption as it occurs under LL. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account endogenous rhythmicity and limiting melatonin administration to the subjective night in order to restrict melanoma progression.},

The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20\% and 40\% in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50\% of building consumption and 20\% of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings.

  abstract = {We have identified an opsin, melanopsin, in photosensitive dermal melanophores of Xenopus laevis. Its deduced amino acid sequence shares greatest homology with cephalopod opsins. The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates the presence of a long cytoplasmic tail with multiple putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this opsin's function may be finely regulated. Melanopsin mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic sites thought to contain deep brain photoreceptors and in the iris, a structure known to be directly photosensitive in amphibians. Melanopsin message is also localized in retinal cells residing in the outermost lamina of the inner nuclear layer where horizontal cells are typically found. Its expression in retinal and nonretinal tissues suggests a role in vision and nonvisual photoreceptive tasks, such as photic control of skin pigmentation, pupillary aperture, and circadian and photoperiodic physiology.},

The circadian clock can be divided into 2 parts: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which receives light cues, and the peripheral clocks that reside in various tissues throughout the body. The peripheral clocks play an integral and unique role in each of their respective tissues, driving the circadian expression of specific genes involved in a variety of physiological functions. The goal of this review is to provide an introduction to and overview of the peripheral clocks, including potential mechanisms, targets, and implications for disease states.

  abstract = {During the last 20 years, numerous clinical trials have examined the therapeutic usefulness of melatonin in different fields of medicine. The objective of this article is to review, in depth, the science regarding clinical trials performed to date. The efficacy of melatonin has been assessed as a treatment of ocular diseases, blood diseases, gastrointestinal tract diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, infectious diseases, neurological diseases, sleep disturbances, aging and depression. Melatonin has been also used as a complementary treatment in anaesthesia, hemodialysis, in vitro fertilization and neonatal care. The conclusion of the current review is that the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapy seems to be well founded for macular degeneration, glaucoma, protection of the gastric mucosa, irritable bowel syndrome, arterial hypertension, diabetes, side effects of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer patients or hemodialysis in patients with renal insufficiency and, especially, for sleep disorders of circadian etiology (jet lag, delayed sleep phase syndrome, sleep deterioration associated with aging, etc.) as well as in those related with neurological degenerative diseases (Alzheimer, etc.,) or Smith-Magenis syndrome. The utility of melatonin in anesthetic procedures has been also confirmed. More clinical studies are required to clarify whether, as the preliminary data suggest, melatonin is useful for treatment of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, infectious diseases, neoplasias or neonatal care. Preliminary data regarding the utility of melatonin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis are either ambiguous or negative. Although in a few cases melatonin seems to aggravate some conditions, the vast majority of studies document the very low toxicity of melatonin over a wide range of doses.},

Some evidence suggests an association between night work and breast cancer risk, possibly through the melatonin pathway.         Methods:~         In a cohort of premenopausal nurses, we prospectively studied the relation between rotating night shift work and breast cancer risk. Total number of months during which the nurses worked rotating night shifts was first assessed at baseline in 1989 and periodically updated thereafter. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).         Results:~         Among 115,022 women without cancer at baseline, 1,352 developed invasive breast cancer during 12 years of follow up. Women who reported more than 20 years of rotating night shift work experienced an elevated relative risk of breast cancer compared with women who did not report any rotating night shift work (multivariate RR = 1.79; 95\% CI = 1.06\textendash 3.01). There was no increase in risk associated with fewer years of rotating night work.         Conclusion:~         Our results suggest a modestly elevated risk of breast cancer after longer periods of rotating night work. Additional studies are warranted to rule out small sample size or uncontrolled sources for confounding as alternative explanations.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, and there is only a limited explanation of why. Risk is highest in the most industrialized countries but also is rising rapidly in the developing world. Known risk factors account for only a portion of the incidence in the high-risk populations, and there has been considerable speculation and many false leads on other possibly major determinants of risk, such as dietary fat. A hallmark of industrialization is the increasing use of electricity to light the night, both within the home and without. It has only recently become clear that this evolutionarily new and, thereby, unnatural exposure can disrupt human circadian rhythmicity, of which three salient features are melatonin production, sleep, and the circadian clock. A convergence of research in cells, rodents, and humans suggests that the health consequences of circadian disruption may be substantial. An innovative experimental model has shown that light at night markedly increases the growth of human breast cancer xenografts in rats. In humans, the theory that light exposure at night increases breast cancer risk leads to specific predictions that are being tested epidemiologically: evidence has accumulated on risk in shift workers, risk in blind women, and the impact of sleep duration on risk. If electric light at night does explain a portion of the breast cancer burden, then there are practical interventions that can be implemented, including more selective use of light and the adoption of recent advances in lighting technology and application.

Opsins, which are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are found in animals, and more than a thousand have been identified so far. Detailed molecular phylogenetic analyses show that the opsin family is divided into seven subfamilies, which correspond well to functional classifications within the family: the vertebrate visual (transducin-coupled) and non-visual opsin subfamily, the encephalopsin/tmt-opsin subfamily, the Gq-coupled opsin/melanopsin subfamily, the Go-coupled opsin subfamily, the neuropsin subfamily, the peropsin subfamily and the retinal photoisomerase subfamily. The subfamilies diversified before the deuterostomes (including vertebrates) split from the protostomes (most invertebrates), suggesting that a common animal ancestor had multiple opsin genes. Opsins have a seven-transmembrane structure similar to that of other GPCRs, but are distinguished by a lysine residue that is a retinal-binding site in the seventh helix. Accumulated evidence suggests that most opsins act as pigments that activate G proteins in a light-dependent manner in both visual and non-visual systems, whereas a few serve as retinal photoisomerases, generating the chromophore used by other opsins, and some opsins have unknown functions.},

The retinal photopigment(s) transducing these light responses in humans have not been characterised. 2 Using the ability of light to suppress nocturnal melatonin production, we aimed to investigate its spectral sensitivity and produce an action spectrum. Melatonin suppression was quantified in 22 volunteers in 215 light exposure trials using monochromatic light (30 min pulse administered at circadian time (CT) 16-18) of different wavelengths ({$\lambda$}max 424, 456, 472, 496, 520 and 548 nm) and irradiances (0.7-65.0 {$\mu$}W cm-2). 3 At each wavelength, suppression of plasma melatonin increased with increasing irradiance. Irradiance-response curves (IRCs) were fitted and the generated half-maximal responses (IR50) were corrected for lens filtering and used to construct an action spectrum. 4 The resulting action spectrum showed unique short-wavelength sensitivity very different from the classical scotopic and photopic visual systems. The lack of fit (r2 {$<$} 0.1) of our action spectrum with the published rod and cone absorption spectra precluded these photoreceptors from having a major role. Cryptochromes 1 and 2 also had a poor fit to the data. Fitting a series of Dartnall nomograms generated for rhodopsin-based photopigments over the {$\lambda$}max range 420-480 nm showed that rhodopsin templates between {$\lambda$}max 457 and 462 nm fitted the data well (r2{$\geq$} 0.73). Of these, the best fit was to the rhodopsin template with {$\lambda$}max 459 nm (r2= 0.74). 5 Our data strongly support a primary role for a novel short-wavelength photopigment in light-induced melatonin suppression and provide the first direct evidence of a non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive system in humans.},

The values of energy density were measured before the blue filter. Lesions were measured before and at 2 and 30 days after irradiation of a 2.8~mm diameter region within the macular arcade. Measures were fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography and long wavelength scanning by the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT) unit. The lesions, which were produced, were scored and compared to irradiant energy density of the blue LED (NSPB500S, Nichia, Tokushima, Japan). The exposure at the 20~J/cm2 produced no detectable result at 2 or 30 days. Exposure at 35~J/cm2 showed definite lesion production without blue filter. With the filter added there was one indication of minor change. At 60~J/cm2 there was extensive heavy, enduring damage without the filter and with the filter damage was present but was significantly attenuated. These results strongly support the conclusion that the blue filter attenuation reduces the frequency of damage by exposure. This experimental system is a useful model for normal human eye aging and continuous spectrum environment irradiance.},

  abstract = {Light is a powerful modulator of cognition through its long-term effects on circadian rhythmicity and direct effects on brain function as identified by neuroimaging. How the direct impact of light on brain function varies with wavelength of light, circadian phase, and sleep homeostasis, and how this differs between individuals, is a largely unexplored area. Using functional MRI, we compared the effects of 1 minute of low-intensity blue (473 nm) and green light (527 nm) exposures on brain responses to an auditory working memory task while varying circadian phase and status of the sleep homeostat. Data were collected in 27 subjects genotyped for the PER3 VNTR (12 PER35/5 and 15 PER34/4) in whom it was previously shown that the brain responses to this task, when conducted in darkness, depend on circadian phase, sleep homeostasis, and genotype. In the morning after sleep, blue light, relative to green light, increased brain responses primarily in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the intraparietal sulcus, but only in PER34/4 individuals. By contrast, in the morning after sleep loss, blue light increased brain responses in a left thalamofrontoparietal circuit to a larger extent than green light, and only so in PER35/5 individuals. In the evening wake maintenance zone following a normal waking day, no differential effect of 1 minute of blue versus green light was observed in either genotype. Comparison of the current results with the findings observed in darkness indicates that light acts as an activating agent particularly under those circumstances in which and in those individuals in whom brain function is jeopardized by an adverse circadian phase and high homeostatic sleep pressure.},

Cloning and biochemical analysis of these evolutionarily conserved proteins has led to detailed molecular insight into the clock mechanism. Few behaviours enjoy the degree of understanding that exists for circadian rhythms at the genetic, cellular and anatomical levels. The circadian clock has so eagerly spilled her secrets that we may soon know the unbroken chain of events from gene to behaviour. It will likely be fruitful to wield this uncommon degree of knowledge to attack one of the most challenging problems in genetics: the basis of complex human behavioural disorders. We review here the genetic screens that provided the entre\'e into the heart of the circadian clock, the model of the clock mechanism that has resulted, and the prospects for using the homologues as candidate genes in studies of human circadian dysrhythmias.},

However, solar radiation, and, depending on spectral output of the source, artificial radiation, has other effects on human physiology and behaviour.

  abstract = {Within the mammalian hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains a circadian clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms. By culturing cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode arrays, we have been able to record spontaneous action potentials from individual SCN neurons for days or weeks, revealing prominent circadian rhythms in firing rate. Despite abundant functional synapses, circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture are not synchronized. After reversible blockade of neuronal firing lasting 2.5 days, circadian firing rhythms re-emerge with unaltered phases. These data suggest that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators, and that synapses formed in vitro are neither necessary for operation of these oscillators nor sufficient for synchronizing them.},

  abstract = {1 Ocular exposure to early morning room light can significantly advance the timing of the human circadian pacemaker. The resetting response to such light has a non-linear relationship to illuminance. The dose-response relationship of the human circadian pacemaker to late evening light of dim to moderate intensity has not been well established. 2 Twenty-three healthy young male and female volunteers took part in a 9 day protocol in which a single experimental light exposure6.5 h in duration was given in the early biological night. The effects of the light exposure on the endogenous circadian phase of the melatonin rhythm and the acute effects of the light exposure on plasma melatonin concentration were calculated. 3 We demonstrate that humans are highly responsive to the phase-delaying effects of light during the early biological night and that both the phase resetting response to light and the acute suppressive effects of light on plasma melatonin follow a logistic dose-response curve, as do many circadian responses to light in mammals. 4 Contrary to expectations, we found that half of the maximal phase-delaying response achieved in response to a single episode of evening bright light ({$\approx$}9000 lux (lx)) can be obtained with just over 1 \% of this light (dim room light of {$\approx$}100 lx). The same held true for the acute suppressive effects of light on plasma melatonin concentrations. This indicates that even small changes in ordinary light exposure during the late evening hours can significantly affect both plasma melatonin concentrations and the entrained phase of the human circadian pacemaker.},
