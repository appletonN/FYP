  abstract = {In the "black box function optimization" problem, a search strategy is required to find an extremal point of a function without knowing the structure of the function or the range of possible function values. Solving such problems efficiently requires two abilities. On the one hand, a strategy must be capable of learning while searching: It must gather global information about the space and concentrate the search in the most promising regions. On the other hand, a strategy must be capable of sustained exploration: If a search of the most promising region does not uncover a satisfactory point, the strategy must redirect its efforts into other regions of the space. This dissertation describes a connectionist learning machine that produces a search strategy called stochastic iterated genetic hillclimb ing (SIGH). Viewed over a short period of time, SIGH displays a coarse-to-fine searching strategy, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. However, in SIGH the convergence process is reversible. The connectionist implementation makes it possible to diverge the search after it has converged, and to recover coarse-grained informa tion about the space that was suppressed during convergence. The successful optimization of a complex function by SIGH usually in volves a series of such converge/diverge cycles.},

  abstract = {This paper studies static and dynamic decentralized versions of the search model known as cellular genetic algorithm (cGA), in which individuals are located in a specific topology and interact only with their neighbors. Making changes in the shape of such topology or in the neighborhood may give birth to a high number of algorithmic variants. We perform these changes in a methodological way by tuning the concept of ratio. Since the relationship (ratio) between the topology and the neighborhood shape defines the search selection pressure, we propose to analyze in depth the influence of this ratio on the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As we will see, it is difficult to decide which ratio is best suited for a given problem. Therefore, we introduce a preprogrammed change of this ratio during the evolution as a possible additional improvement that removes the need of specifying a single ratio. A later refinement will lead us to the first adaptive dynamic kind of cellular models to our knowledge. We conclude that these dynamic cGAs have the most desirable behavior among all the evaluated ones in terms of efficiency and accuracy; we validate our results on a set of seven different problems of considerable complexity in order to better sustain our conclusions.},

However, light information serves a parallel set of functions in biology that are essential for our health and wellbeing, including the synchronisation of our circadian clock to the solar day. The circadian clock drives endogenous daily rhythms across human physiology and behaviour. However, when the circadian clock is not appropriately aligned with external time, disturbances in sleep/wake behaviours, alertness, mood and performance arise. Here, the important question of how blindness \textemdash{} a loss of visual perception \textemdash{} impacts the circadian clock's synchronisation with the solar day is discussed. This review will explore how and why vision loss can cause significant disruptions in behaviour and physiology that go beyond the loss of conscious visual perception, and why blindness is not as closely linked with deficits in photoentrainment as we might expect.},

  abstract = {There is a large class of electromagnetic radiators designated as wire antennas. As a rule, an inductive process is used to design these antennas. Either an integral equation is formulated or a simulator is used that gives the current distributions on the wires of the antenna, from which the electromagnetic properties of the antenna can then be determined. Once the antenna properties are known, the parameters are optimized, using guides such as intuition, experience, simplified equations, or empirical studies. However, using an electromagnetics simulator in conjunction with a genetic algorithm (GA), it is possible to design an antenna using a completely deductive approach: the desired electromagnetic properties of the antenna are specified, and the wire configuration that most closely produces these results is then synthesized by the algorithm. In this paper, we describe four antennas designed using GAs. The first is a monopole, loaded with a modified folded dipole that was designed to radiate uniform power over the hemisphere at a frequency of 1.6 GHz. The second antenna consists of seven wires, the locations and lengths of which are determined by the GA alone, that radiates waves with right-hand-circular polarization at elevation angles above 10/spl deg/, also at 1.6 GHz. The last two antennas are modified Yagis. One is designed for a broad frequency band and very low sidelobes at a center frequency of 235 MHz. The other is designed for high gain at a single frequency of 432 MHz. We have built and tested these antennas.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

  abstract = {Background: Some small controlled studies have found that dawn simulation is effective in treating seasonal affective disorder (SAD). With a larger sample size and a longer duration of treatment, we compared dawn simulation with bright light therapy and a placebo condition in patients with SAD. Method: Medication-free patients with SAD were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: bright light therapy (10,000 lux for 30 min, from 6:00 am to 6:30 am), dawn simulation (1.5 hour dawn signal from 4:30 am to 6:00 am peaking at 250 lux), and a placebo condition, a dim red light (1.5 hour dawn signal from 4:30 am to 6:00 am peaking at 0.5 lux.) Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the subjects were blindly rated by a psychiatrist using the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD). We modeled the profiles of the remissions (SIGH-SAD {$\leq$} 8) and response ({$\geq$}50\% decrease in SIGH-SAD) to treatment over time using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The sample consisted of 95 subjects who were randomized to the three conditions: bright light (n = 33), dawn simulation (n = 31) and placebo (n = 31). Dawn simulation was associated with greater remission (p {$<$} .05) and response (p {$<$} .001) rates compared to the placebo. Bright light did not differ significantly from the placebo. Dawn simulation was associated with greater remission (p {$<$} .01) and response (p {$<$} .001) rates compared to the bright light therapy. The mean daily hours of sunshine during the week before each visit were associated with a significant increase in likelihood of both remission (p {$<$} .001) and response (p {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Dawn simulation was associated with greater remission and response rates compared to the placebo and compared to bright light therapy. The hours of sunshine during the week before each assessment were associated with a positive clinical response.},

Sixteen female employees worked for three consecutive time periods under conventional fluorescent illumination (14 days), full-spectrum fluorescent illumination (14 days), and conventional fluorescent illumination (nine days).Daily work efficiency was determined by an established Company system. Mood states were assessed by the Profile of Mood States which was administered once during each of the three study time periods. Light intensity was also measured, since lumen output varied between full-spectrum and conventional lamps. At the conclusion of the study, subjects completed a questionnaire reporting a preference for either full-spectrum or conventional illumination.Results. Research hypotheses predicting significant improvement of work efficiency and mood states with exposure to full-spectrum as opposed to conventional fluorescent illumination were not supported. Measured work efficiency and mood states were not significantly altered in association with the change from conventional fluorescent illumination to full-spectrum and back. Findings failed to support previous light research which indicated that full-spectrum illumination may enhance biological and psychophysiological functions relative to work performance.A significant majority of the subjects (13 out of 16) preferred full-spectrum illumination, claiming they experienced fewer headaches and an improved atmosphere. Despite significantly lower light levels during the full-spectrum condition, subjects stated that full-spectrum illumination appeared brighter and improved visual acuity. These statements are supportive of previous studies which indicate that visual clarity is enhanced under illumination of superior color rendering properties. function show\_abstract() \{   \$('\#abstract1').hide();   \$('\#abstract2').show();   \$('\#abstract\_expand').hide(); \} \ding{116}\cyrchar\CYRP\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrk\cyrchar\cyra\cyrchar\cyrz\cyrchar\cyra\cyrchar\cyrt\cyrchar\cyrsftsn{} \cyrchar\cyrp\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrl\cyrchar\cyrn\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrs\cyrchar\cyrt\cyrchar\cyrsftsn\cyrchar\cyryu},

Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Descartes intuitively anticipated the so-called `binding problem' of consciousness and thought that the pineal gland enables spatio-temporal integration in cognitive processing. Recent findings indicate that a major role in the process of temporal integration and binding involve neurons in suprachiasmatic nuclei, specifically targeting the pineal gland and other structures, and control the neuroendocrine rhythms. Melatonin is an endocrine output signal of the clock and provides circadian information as an endogenous synchronizer which stabilizes and reinforces circadian rhythms. This integrative process occurs at the different levels of the circadian network via gene expression in some brain regions and peripheral structures that enables integration of circadian, hormonal, and metabolic information and creating temporal order of bodily and mental experience. This specific temporal order is reflected in associative sequentiality that is necessary for cognition, behavior and all processes of memory consolidation that must preserve all information in the temporal causal order and synchrony. In this context, recent findings suggest that melatonin could be a potential regulator in the processes that contribute to memory formation, long-term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and other brain regions. There is evidence that stress disrupts normal activity and memory consolidation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this process leads to memories that are stored without a contextual or spatiotemporal frame. These findings emphasize a specific role of melatonin in mechanisms of consciousness, memory and stress and are also consistent with reported studies that indicate melatonin alterations under stressful conditions and in mental disorders.},

  abstract = {The pineal gland expresses a group of proteins essential for rhythmic melatonin production. This pineal-specific phenotype is the consequence of a temporally and spacially controlled program of gene expression. Understanding of pineal circadian biology has been greatly facilitated in recent years by a number of molecular studies, including the cloning of N-acetyltransferase, the determination of the in vivo involvement of the cAMP-inducible early repressor in the regulation of N-acetyltransferase, and the identification of a pineal transcriptional regulatory element and its interaction with the cone-rod homeobox protein. Likewise, appreciation the physiological roles of melatonin has increased dramatically with the cloning and targeted knockout of melatonin receptors. With these molecular tools in hand, we can now address more specific questions about how and why melatonin is made in the pineal at night and about how it influences the rest of the body.},

Exposure to the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation produced by light sources can damage both the eye and skin, through both thermal and photochemical mechanisms. Such damage is rare for indoor lighting installations designed for vision but can occur in some situations. The second is light operating through the visual system. Lighting enables us to see but lighting conditions that cause visual discomfort are likely to lead to eyestrain. Anyone who frequently experiences eyestrain is not enjoying the best of health. The lighting conditions that cause visual discomfort in buildings are well known and easily avoided. The third is light operating through the circadian system. This is known to influence sleep patterns and believed to be linked to the development of breast cancer among night shift workers., There is still much to learn about the impact of light on human health but what is known is enough to ensure that the topic requires the attention of all those concerned with the lighting of buildings.},

  abstract = {The perceived color of an object depends on the illuminating light source, the reflection or transmission of light by the object, and the response of the human observer. The numerical specification of colors, using the Commission internationale de l'\'eclairage (CIE) system of colorimetry, requires a spectral power distribution for the light source, reflectance or transmittance data in the visible region for the object, and defined numerical descriptions for the color responses of the observer. These data allow calculation of the three tristimulus values (X, Y, and Z), defining the color of the object, and these coordinates locate the position of the color in a 3-D color space. The difference in color between two objects is related to the distance between their respective points in the color space. The initially calculated tristimulus values are usually transformed into other coordinate systems, for example, the CIELAB system, to provide a more visually uniform color space in which the perceived difference in color of two objects corresponds closely to the separation of their points in the color space. Colorimetry has become a standard industrial technique for quality control and for colorant recipe formulation and modification.},

  abstract = {The circadian secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland and retinae is a direct output of circadian oscillators and of the circadian system in many species of vertebrates. This signal affects a broad array of physiological and behavioral processes, making a generalized hypothesis for melatonin function an elusive objective. Still, there are some common features of melatonin function. First, melatonin biosynthesis is always associated with photoreceptors and/or cells that are embryonically derived from photoreceptors. Second, melatonin frequently affects the perception of the photic environment and has as its site of action structures involved in vision. Finally, melatonin affects overt circadian function at least partially via regulation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or its hofnologues. The mechanisms by which melatonin affects circadian rhythms and other downstream processes are unknown, but they include interaction with a class of membrane-bound receptors that affect intracellular processes through guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein second messenger systems. Investigation of mechanisms by which melatonin affects its target tissues may unveil basic concepts of neuromodulation, visual system function, and the circadian clock.},

  abstract = {To determine whether human hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is related to the alertness level during wakefulness, 10 healthy young men were studied under resting conditions in the daytime (0900\textendash 1800 h) after an 8-h nighttime sleep (2300\textendash 0700 h). A serial 70-sec gaze fixation task was required every 10 min throughout the daytime experimental session. The corresponding waking electroencephalographic (EEG) segments were submitted to quantitative spectral analysis, from which EEG {$\beta$} activity (absolute power density in the 13\textendash 35 Hz frequency band), an index of central alertness, was computed. Blood was collected continuously through an indwelling venous catheter and sampled at 10-min intervals. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured by RIA, and the corresponding secretory rates were determined by a deconvolution procedure.Analysis of individual profiles demonstrated a declining tendency for EEG {$\beta$} activity and cortisol secretory rate, with an overall temporal relationship indicated by positive and significant cross-correlation coefficients between the two variables in all subjects (average r= 0.565, P \&lt; 0.001). Changes in cortisol secretion lagged behind fluctuations in EEG {$\beta$} activity, with an average delay of 10 min for all the subjects. On the average, 4.6 {$\pm$} 0.4 cortisol secretory pulses and 4.9 {$\pm$} 0.5 peaks in EEG {$\beta$} activity were identified by a detection algorithm. A significant, although not systematic, association between the episodes in the two variables was found: 44\% of the peaks in EEG {$\beta$} activity (relative amplitude, near 125\%; P \&lt; 0.001) occurred during an ascending phase of cortisol secretion, cortisol secretory rates increasing by 40\% (P \&lt; 0.01) 10-min after peaks in EEG {$\beta$} activity. However, no significant change in EEG {$\beta$} activity was observed during the period from 50 min before to 50 min after pulses in cortisol secretion.In conclusion, the present study describes a temporal coupling between cortisol release and central alertness, as reflected in the waking EEG{$\beta$} activity. These findings suggest the existence of connections between the mechanisms involved in the control of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity and the activation processes of the brain, which undergoes varying degrees of alertness throughout daytime wakefulness.},

Yet the demonstration of an intensity-dependent neuroendocrine response to bright light has led to renewed consideration of light as a possible synchronizer of the human circadian pacemaker. In a laboratory study, the output of the circadian pacemaker of an elderly woman was monitored before and after exposure to 4 hours of bright light for seven consecutive evenings, and before and after a control study in ordinary room light while her sleep-wake schedule and social contacts remained unchanged. The exposure to bright light in the evening induced a 6-hour delay shift of her circadian pacemaker, as indicated by recordings of body temperature and cortisol secretion. The unexpected magnitude, rapidity, and stability of the shift challenge existing concepts regarding circadian phase-resetting capacity in man and suggest that exposure to bright light can indeed reset the human circadian pacemaker, which controls daily variations in physiologic, behavioral, and cognitive function.},

In this paper, we reexamine the evidence for that claim and demonstrate that there were some fundamental flaws in the experimental design of the previous studies on which this conclusion was based. We report new studies in which we tested the efficacy of LD cycles in entraining the circadian rhythms of human subjects living in isolation from environmental time cues. We found that the cyclic alternation of light and dark, when applied to human subjects in a comparable way to experiments in other species, was an effective entraining agent. Our results and a critical review of the literature indicate that a LD cycle alone can be an effective environmental synchronizer of the human circadian timing system. Other factors, such as the knowledge of time of day, social contacts, the feeding schedule, and the imposed rest-activity schedule may contribute to stable entrainment, although their relative strengths as synchronizers have yet to be determined.},

  abstract = {Most facets of mammalian physiology and behavior vary according to time-of-day thanks to an endogenous ``circadian'' clock. Therefore, it is not surprising that many aspects of pharmacology and toxicology also oscillate according to the same 24-hour clocks. Daily oscillations in abundance of proteins necessary for either drug absorption or metabolism result in circadian pharmacokinetics; and oscillations in the physiological systems targeted by these drugs result in circadian pharmacodynamics. These clocks are present in most cells of the body, but organized in hierarchical fashion. Interestingly, some aspects of physiology and behavior are controlled directly via a ``master clock'' in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, while others are controlled by ``slave'' oscillators in separate brain regions or body tissues. Recent research shows that these clocks can respond to different cues, and thereby show different phase relationships. Therefore, full prediction of chronopharmacology in pathological contexts will likely require a systems biology approach considering ``chrono-interactions'' among different clock-regulated systems.},

  abstract = {In addition to well-characterised visual systems, many organisms, including the craniates, possess a complex sensory system of non-visual photoreceptors that detect light for a diverse array of non-image-forming tasks. Like the photoreceptors of image-forming systems, the pigments contained within non-visual photoreceptive cells comprise a protein component (opsin) linked to a light-sensitive retinal chromophore derived from vitamin A. In mammals, one of the most important of these non-visual pigments is melanopsin (encoded by the OPN4 gene, specifically that of the ``mammal-like'' or ``m-class''), which is restricted in expression to a subset of retinal ganglion cells and has been shown to be the conduit through which light regulates many physiological activities, including the photoentrainment of circadian systems (e.g. the sleep cycle) and the pupillary reflex response. In non-mammals, melanopsin exists as two distinct gene lineages, namely the m-class and x-class (``Xenopus-like''), and both are expressed in many different tissues, including the eyes, skin, fins, gills, brain and pineal gland; however, the functional roles mediated by melanopsin in these ``lower'' vertebrates remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we discuss the evolutionary history of the melanopsin gene, its diverse patterns of expression and transcriptional output, the functional roles so far determined, and the clinical significance of this critical and phylogenetically most ancient opsin-based system of irradiance detection.},

  abstract = {Mutation is an important operator in genetic algorithms (GAs), as it ensures maintenance of diversity in evolving populations of GAs. Real-parameter GAs (RGAs) handle real-valued variables directly without going to in a binary string representation of variables. Although RGAs were first suggested in early nineties, the mutation operator is still implemented variablewise and independently for each variable. In this paper, we investigate the effect of five different mutation schemes for RGAs for two different mutation operators. Based on extensive simulation studies, it is observed that a mutation clock implementation is computationally quick and also efficient in finding a solution close to the optimum on four different problems used in this study for both mutation operators. Moreover, parametric studies with their associated parameters reveal suitable working ranges of the parameters. Interestingly, both mutation operators with their respective optimal parameter settings are found to possess a similar inherent probability of offspring creation, a matter that is believed to the reason for their superior working. This study signifies that the longsuggested mutation clock operator should be considered as a valuable mutation operator for RGAs.},

This approach offers the ability to cope with environmental changes without human intervention, but to be effective it needs an automatic parameter control mechanism to adjust the evolutionary algorithm (EA) appropriately. In particular, mutation step sizes (\$\textbackslash sigma\$) and the time spent on fitness evaluation (\$\textbackslash tau\$) have a strong influence on the performance of an EA. In this paper, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel method for self-adapting \$\textbackslash tau\$ during runtime. The results show that this mechanism is viable: the EA using this self-adaptative control scheme consistently shows decent performance without a priori tuning or human intervention during a run.},

Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO.

  abstract = {Photometric stereo is a well-known technique for recovering surface normals of a surface but requires three or more images of a surface taken under illumination from different directions. At best, one may dispense with the need for multiple images by using colored lights tuned to camera filters. But a less restrictive paradigm is available that uses the orientation-from-color approach, wherein multiple broadband illuminants impinge on a surface simultaneously. In that method, colors for a Lambertian surface lie on an ellipsoid in color space. The method has been applied mainly to single-color objects, with ellipsoid quadratic-form parameters determined from a large number of pixels. However, recently Petrov and Antonova [Color Res.Appl.21, 97 (1996)] developed an entirely local approach, useful also for multicolored objects with color uniform in each patch. We investigate to what extent a method such as that of Petrov and Antonova can be applied in the ostensibly simpler situation in which the complex lighting environment is known, i.e., a color photometric stereo situation, with all lights in play at once with only a single image to analyze. We find that, assuming a simple model of color formation, we are able to recover the object colors along with surface normals, using only a single image. Because we immerse the object in a known lighting environment, we show that only half of the equations utilized by Petrov and Antonova are actually needed, making the method more stable. Nevertheless, solutions do not exist at every pixel; instead we may determine a best estimate of patch color, using a robust estimator, and then apply that estimate throughout a patch. Results are shown to be quite good compared with ground truth. The simple color model can often be made to hold more exactly by transforming the color space into one corresponding to spectrally sharpened sensors, which are a matrix transform away from the actual camera sensors. In our study the reliability and accuracy of the normal vector and of the surface color recovery algorithm are improved by this straightforward transformation.},

Hundred participants were first asked to choose the most suitable lighting arrangement for each impression (clarity, spaciousness, relaxation, privacy, pleasantness and order) under the 500lux illuminance. In the second stage, they were asked to compare the two illuminances (500 and 320lux) for the lighting arrangement they selected in the first stage. There was a statistically significant relation between impressions and lighting arrangements, also between impressions and lighting levels. Thus, different lighting arrangements and lighting levels could be used to enhance the clarity, spaciousness, relaxation, privacy, pleasantness and order of a room.

  abstract = {High intensity light is widely used as an antidepressant for the treatment of winter depression. There is no doubt that treatment with light can substantially reduce and even eliminate all symptoms. However, establishing that this effect is greater than what could be produced by a placebo-control treatment is hampered by the difficulty in finding an appropriate placebo for light treatment. This paper compares two light treatment studies with good placebo controls. The first study employed a crossover design between morning light and morning placebo. The second, which is still in progress, employs a parallel design with morning light, morning placebo and evening light groups. The first study did not show a statistically significant difference between light and placebo. Although the response rates in the second study are much greater than in the first study, there is still no significant difference between light and placebo. The response to light treatment is much greater than in the first study, but the response to placebo treatment is also much greater. Several possible reasons for the greater antidepressant effects in the second study are discussed, such as a larger placebo component in all three treatments due to a more optimistic staff. Although it would be premature to draw final conclusions about efficacy, we have shown that for light treatment, like antidepressant drug treatment, most of the antidepressant effect can be attributed to placebo effects.},

  abstract = {Associations between cognitive performance and cortisol have variously been reported for measures of both cortisol level and change, and for some domains of cognitive functioning more than others. In this study, associations between cortisol secretion measures and cognitive performance were examined in 50 healthy older people (mean age 74years; 34F /16M). Participants provided 16 accurately timed saliva samples over 2 consecutive days to determine diurnal profiles of cortisol secretion. Overall cognitive performance (OCP) was measured as the principal component of a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests. Across a 30year age range, there was a strong inverse correlation between age and OCP. Age and poorer OCP were also associated with an attenuated cortisol awakening response (CAR), defined as the rise from 0\textendash 30min after awakening, and a subsequent less steep fall in cortisol level over the rest of the day. Partialling analyses, suggested that the correlation between fall in cortisol over the day and OCP was independent of age. Both older age and less cortisol change were particularly related to poorer performance on tests of declarative memory and executive functioning. Our conclusions are that during the short post-awakening period, an exception exists to the generally pertaining association between higher levels of cortisol and poorer cognitive performance. Consequentially dynamic measures reflecting the rise (CAR) and fall from the post-awakening peak may be particularly salient in helping to explain links between cortisol and cognitive performance. Finally our pattern of results across different cognitive tests suggests an association between cortisol and those domains of cognitive functioning which depend crucially on the integrity of the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex.},

This atlas shows that more than 80\% of the world and more than 99\% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60\% of Europeans and nearly 80\% of North Americans. Moreover, 23\% of the world's land surfaces between 75\textdegree N and 60\textdegree S, 88\% of Europe, and almost half of the United States experience light-polluted nights. The world atlas of zenith artificial night sky brightness is modelled with VIIRS DNB data and calibrated with more than 35,000 observations.

  abstract = {Melatonin is a hormone primarily produced by the pineal gland at night and is suppressed by exposure to light. Experimental studies have indicated that melatonin may protect against cancer development. In the majority of totally blind people, melatonin is never suppressed by light exposure. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that blind people have a decreased cancer incidence, and that this effect is more pronounced in the totally blind than in the severely visually impaired. We identified a cohort of 1,567 totally blind and 13,292 severely visually impaired subjects and obtained information about cancer incidence from the Swedish Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) based on the number of person-years and incidence rates specific for national age, sex, and calendar year. Totally blind people had a lower incidence of all cancers combined [SIR = 0.69; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-0.82]. The risk reduction was observed in both men and women and was equally pronounced in hormone-dependent tumors as in other types of cancer. In the severely visually impaired, SIR was 0.95 (95\% CI = 0.91-1.00). The findings support the hypothesis that blind people have a lower cancer incidence, although other explanations than the higher melatonin exposure must also be considered.},

  abstract = {Levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland, follow a daily, 24-hour rhythm with concentrations reaching a minimum in the evening and a peak near rising time. In addition, cortisol levels exhibit a sharp peak in concentration within the first hour after waking; this is known as the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The present study is a secondary analysis of a larger study investigating the impact of short-wavelength light on CAR in adolescents who were sleep restricted. The study ran over the course of three overnight sessions, at least one week apart. The experimental sessions differed in terms of the light exposure scenarios experienced during the evening prior to sleeping in the laboratory and during the morning after waking from a 4.5-hour sleep opportunity. Eighteen adolescents aged 12\textendash 17 years were exposed to dim light or to 40 lux (0.401\,W/m2) of 470-nm peaking light for 80 minutes after awakening. Saliva samples were collected every 20 minutes to assess CAR. Exposure to short-wavelength light in the morning significantly enhanced CAR compared to dim light. Morning exposure to short-wavelength light may be a simple, yet practical way to better prepare adolescents for an active day.},

  abstract = {A model of circadian phototransduction was published in 2005 to predict the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system to narrow-band and polychromatic light sources by combining responses to light from the spectral-opponent ``blue'' versus ``yellow'' cone bipolar pathway with direct responses to light by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. In the model, depolarizing ``blue'' responses, but not hyperpolarizing ``yellow'' responses, from the ``blue'' versus ``yellow'' pathway are combined with the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell responses. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell neurons are known to be much slower to respond to light than the cone pathway, so an implication of the model is that periodic flashes of ``blue'' light, but not ``yellow'' light, would be effective for stimulating the circadian system. A within-subjects study was designed to test the implications of the model regarding retinal exposures to brief flashes of light. The study was also aimed at broadening the foundation for clinical treatment of circadian sleep disorders by delivering flashing light through closed eyelids while people were asleep. In addition to a dark control night, the eyelids of 16 subjects were exposed to three light-stimulus conditions in the phase delay portion of the phase response curve while they were asleep: (1) 2-second flashes of 111 W/m2 of blue ({$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 480 nm) light once every minute for 1 hour, (2) 131 W/m2 of green ({$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 527 nm) light, continuously on for 1 hour, and (3) 2-second flashes of the same green light once every minute for 1 hour. Inferential statistics showed that the blue flash light-stimulus condition significantly delayed circadian phase and significantly suppressed nocturnal melatonin. The results of this study further our basic understanding of circadian phototransduction and broaden the technical foundations for delivering light through closed eyelids during sleep for treating circadian sleep disorders.},

The system uses an image display to produce a sequence of structured diffuse illumination patterns and a digital camera to acquire the corresponding sequence of images. An image enhancement algorithm, which measures the local intensity variations between bright- and dark-field illumination conditions, yields a final image in which the defects are revealed with a high contrast. Subsequently, an image segmentation algorithm, which compares statistically the enhanced image of the inspected surface with the corresponding image for a defect-free template, allows separating defects from non-defects with an adjusting decision threshold. The method can be applied to shiny surfaces of any material including metal, plastic and glass. The described method was tested on the plastic surface of a car dashboard system. We were able to detect not only scratches but also dust and fingerprints. In our experiment we observed a detection contrast increase from about 40\%, when using an extended light source, to more than 90\% when using a structured light source. The presented method is simple, robust and can be carried out with short cycle times, making it appropriate for applications in industrial environments.},

This increase after awakening, a phenomenon termed the cortisol awakening response (CAR), appears to be a distinct feature of the hypothalamus\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal (HPA) axis, superimposing the circadian rhythmicity of cortisol secretion. Several studies point towards an important role of the hippocampus and, additionally, other brain structures (e. g. amygdala, prefrontal cortex, suprachiasmatic nucleus) in the regulation of the CAR. There is increasing knowledge that the CAR is influenced by a variety of factors such as gender, health status, and health behavior or stress perception. However, the exact function of the profound cortisol increase after awakening is still not clarified. We hypothesize that the anticipation of the upcoming day is of major relevance for the magnitude of the CAR. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the neural regulation of the CAR and factors influencing this phenomenon and considerations are addressed concerning the exact function of the CAR.},

  abstract = {The circadian clock is the internal timing machine that can sustain rhythms of about 24 hours in the absence of external cues. The circadian clock is operated by the feedback loops of the circadian genes in the mammalian central pacemaker, as well as in most peripheral tissues. The mammalian central pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain and controls the activity of peripheral clocks through the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous systems. The circadian clock regulates hundreds of functions in the human body. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to mammalian tumorigenesis and tumour progression, and has been used as an independent prognostic factor of survival time for patients with certain metastatic cancers. Normal and malignant tissues often show asynchronies in cell proliferation and metabolic rhythms. Based on these observations, cancer chronotherapy has been developed to improve the efficacy in cancer treatment and the quality of patients' life. The circadian clock functions in vivo as a tumour suppressor at the systemic, cellular and molecular levels. The central clock is capable of generating 24-hour cell-proliferation rhythms in peripheral tissues through the activity of the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous systems. Molecular clocks in peripheral tissues control cell-proliferation rhythms by regulating the expression of cell-cycle genes. The core circadian genes are also involved in regulating cell proliferation. The circadian clock in peripheral tissues responds directly to DNA damage and could be important in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The molecular clockworks and cell-cycle clocks in peripheral tissues can be regulated simultaneously by the central clock, through interacting signalling pathways. Further study of the mechanism of the circadian clock in tumour suppression and the DNA-damage response has important implications for cancer therapy.},

The idea of coevolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has usually resulted in virtual entities that are not buildable, while embodied evolution in actual robotics is constrained by the slow pace of real time. The work we present takes a step in addressing the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of elementary components that stick together. Evolution takes place in a simulator that computes forces and stresses and predicts stability of three-dimensional brick structures. The final printout of our program is a schematic assembly, which is then built physically. We demonstrate the functionality of this approach to robot body building with many evolved artifacts.},

Here we investigated the role of morning light exposure as a countermeasure for impaired cognitive performance and mood under sleep restriction (SR). Seventeen participants took part of a 48h laboratory protocol, during which three different light settings (separated by 2 wks) were administered each morning after two 6-h sleep restriction nights: a blue monochromatic LED (light-emitting diode) light condition (BL; 100 lux at 470 nm for 20 min) starting 2 h after scheduled wake-up time, a dawn-simulating light (DsL) starting 30 min before and ending 20 min after scheduled wake-up time (polychromatic light gradually increasing from 0 to 250 lux), and a dim light (DL) condition for 2 h beginning upon scheduled wake time ({$<$}8 lux). Cognitive tasks were performed every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness, and questionnaires were administered hourly to assess subjective sleepiness, mood, and well-being. Salivary melatonin and cortisol were collected throughout scheduled wakefulness in regular intervals, and the effects on melatonin were measured after only one light pulse. Following the first SR, analysis of the time course of cognitive performance during scheduled wakefulness indicated a decrease following DL, whereas it remained stable following BL and significantly improved after DsL. Cognitive performance levels during the second day after SR were not significantly affected by the different light conditions. However, after both SR nights, mood and well-being were significantly enhanced after exposure to morning DsL compared with DL and BL. Melatonin onset occurred earlier after morning BL exposure, than after morning DsL and DL, whereas salivary cortisol levels were higher at wake-up time after DsL compared with BL and DL. Our data indicate that exposure to an artificial morning dawn simulation light improves subjective well-being, mood, and cognitive performance, as compared with DL and BL, with minimal impact on circadian phase. Thus, DsL may provide an effective strategy for enhancing cognitive performance, well-being, and mood under mild sleep restriction.},

The biological balance is disrupted both by the spectral mismatching well as their pulsed light. This is the case when we use additive RGB synthesis in white light sources. We do not think about how stress causes such light in the animals and plant environments. As a result, the negative biological effects of artificial LED lighting are physiological cellular disorders, population changes and ecosystem division. We have reached the technological level that allows us to build some sources that are spectral compatible with the sunlight.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the evidence base for the efficacy of light therapy in treating mood disorders. METHOD: The authors systematically searched PubMed (January 1975 to July 2003) to identify randomized, controlled trials of light therapy for mood disorders that fulfilled predefined criteria. These articles were abstracted, and data were synthesized by disease and intervention category. RESULTS: Only 13\% of the studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses revealed that a significant reduction in depression symptom severity was associated with bright light treatment (eight studies, having an effect size of 0.84 and 95\% confidence interval [CI] of 0.60 to 1.08) and dawn simulation in seasonal affective disorder (five studies; effect size=0.73, 95\% CI=0.37 to 1.08) and with bright light treatment in nonseasonal depression (three studies; effect size=0.53, 95\% CI=0.18 to 0.89). Bright light as an adjunct to antidepressant pharmacotherapy for nonseasonal depression was not effective (five studies; effect size=\textendash 0.01, 95\% CI=\textendash 0.36 to 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Many reports of the efficacy of light therapy are not based on rigorous study designs. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that bright light treatment and dawn simulation for seasonal affective disorder and bright light for nonseasonal depression are efficacious, with effect sizes equivalent to those in most antidepressant pharmacotherapy trials. Adopting standard approaches to light therapy's specific issues (e.g., defining parameters of active versus placebo conditions) and incorporating rigorous designs (e.g., adequate group sizes, randomized assignment) are necessary to evaluate light therapy for mood disorders.},

  abstract = {Numbers of animal species react to the natural phenomenon of fire, but only humans have learnt to control it and to make it at will. Natural fires caused overwhelmingly by lightning are highly evident on many landscapes. Birds such as hawks, and some other predators, are alert to opportunities to catch animals including invertebrates disturbed by such fires and similar benefits are likely to underlie the first human involvements with fires. Early hominins would undoubtedly have been aware of such fires, as are savanna chimpanzees in the present. Rather than as an event, the discovery of fire use may be seen as a set of processes happening over the long term. Eventually, fire became embedded in human behaviour, so that it is involved in almost all advanced technologies. Fire has also influenced human biology, assisting in providing the high-quality diet which has fuelled the increase in brain size through the Pleistocene. Direct evidence of early fire in archaeology remains rare, but from 1.5 Ma onward surprising numbers of sites preserve some evidence of burnt material. By the Middle Pleistocene, recognizable hearths demonstrate a social and economic focus on many sites. The evidence of archaeological sites has to be evaluated against postulates of biological models such as the `cooking hypothesis' or the `social brain', and questions of social cooperation and the origins of language. Although much remains to be worked out, it is plain that fire control has had a major impact in the course of human evolution.This article is part of the themed issue `The interaction of fire and mankind'.},

Interest has been stimulated by new archaeological finds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and also by major inputs from other disciplines, including primatology and evolutionary psychology. Evidence for fire is, however, often disputed, especially with regard to the early cases in Africa. Interpretations often struggle to take into account the implications of a huge bias in archaeological preservation, which means that our surviving evidence does not accurately map the past. Additionally, there is often a `yes-no' presence/absence approach to fire, which does not recognise that earliest hominin fire use may have occurred in interaction with natural fire, and may not even have included deliberate hearth use in its first stages. Here we examine the need to integrate different approaches to the issues of early fire-use, considering especially the earliest archaeological evidence and the `cooking hypothesis', while also tackling the issues of apparent differences in early African and European fire records.},

  abstract = {In traditional evolutionary robotics, robot controllers are evolved in a separate design phase preceding actual deployment; we call this off-line evolution. Alternatively, robot controllers can evolve while the robots perform their proper tasks, during the actual operational phase; we call this on-line evolution. In this paper we describe three principal categories of on-line evolution for developing robot controllers (encapsulated, distributed, and hybrid), present an evolutionary algorithm belonging to the first category (the ({$\mu~$}+~1) on-line algorithm), and perform an extensive study of its behaviour. In particular, we use the Bonesa parameter tuning method to explore its parameter space. This delivers near-optimal settings for our algorithm in a number of tasks and, even more importantly, it offers profound insights into the impact of our algorithm's parameters and features. Our experimental analysis of ({$\mu~$}+~1) on-line shows that it seems preferable to try many alternative solutions and spend little effort on refining possibly faulty assessments; that there is no single combination of parameters that performs well on all problem instances and that the most influential parameter of this algorithm\textemdash and therefore the prime candidate for a control scheme\textemdash is the evaluation length {$\tau$}.},

  abstract = {Daily cycles in physiology and behaviour are probably a universal feature of multicellular organisms. These rhythms are predominantly driven by endogenous clocks with a periodicity approximating to one day, i.e. circadian. In mammals, the circadian clock governing activity/ rest, neuroendocrine and autonomic rhythms lies in the hypothalamus, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Intrinsic circadian oscillators are also present in the retina. The SCN ``clockwork'' is based on a cell autonomous, genetically determined mechanism. Mammalian homologues of a number of Drosophila genes which encode elements of the fly circadian mechanism have recently been identified. In Drosophila, the protein products of these genes interact in a negative feedback loop, establishing a circadian cycle in gene expression. Characterisation of the roles played by putative mammalian clock genes in the SCN, and how the emergent cellular signal imposes order over the entire neuraxis, will provide a fundamental contribution to our understanding of the molecular basis of behaviour.

Twenty-four volunteers were each tested over the course of five consecutive days, including a practice session and four test sessions, one for each of the lighting conditions. Volunteers showed highest visual acuity as measured on symbol identification and color recognition tasks with LED relative to fluorescent lighting and this effect was greatest at highest color temperatures. In terms of psychological and cognitive performance, volunteers showed increased fatigue ratings with fluorescent relative to LED, and this effect was associated with slower response times on tasks measuring spatial and verbal memory. Relevance to industry Recent increases in the number of LED technologies being incorporated into industrial lighting applications carry implications for worker performance.

In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},

  abstract = {General data protection regulation (GDPR) has been applied since 25 May 2018. It is designed to harmonize data privacy laws in European Union. It clearly defines what personal data is and identifies involved objects as Controller, Processor and Data subject. Although it focuses over the procedures in the organizations that have contact with personal data, it raises technological challenges about data storage, data processing, access control, identity management, system resilience, cybersecurity, post security breach measures, transactions traceability. We offer a new conceptual model with a trust management technology between controllers and data processors, which is based on the capabilities of the DLT. It can be useful in synthesizing software architectures, managing change due to the implementation of GDPR, ePrivacy, Policy Directive, and another forthcoming EU legislation. The article aims to present where the blockchain implementation can be helpful for the GDPR compliant operations. It doesn't cover the GDPR or blockchain in deep technical details, but just points out the important aspects where the DLT solution could be applicable. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the paper. Section 2 describes the methodology used in this article. Section 3 introduces the GDPR and points out with short descriptions the key principles of the regulation. Section 4 covers brief explanation what blockchain is with examples from the Bitcoin implementation. Terms like transaction, transactions integrity, block, consensus are described here. Permissioned and permissionless blockchain implementations with their basic difference in the level of trust. Section 5 defines the main intersection points between GDPR compliance and the blockchain. Section 6 presents the Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework founded by Open Linux Foundation and IBM. The section focuses over the unique Hyperledger fabric abilities, which leads to increased confidentiality, transaction speed, traceability, access control, identity management, endorsement policies and smart contracts applications. Section 7 shows related research in this area. In conclusion the study reveals the biggest challenge in the blockchain application in the GDPR compliant frameworks.}

Complex environments are characterized by multiple, and often conflicting time signals demanding flexible mechanisms of adaptation of endogenous rhythms to external time. Traditionally this process of circadian entrainment has been conceptualized in a hierarchical scheme with a light-reset master pacemaker residing in the hypothalamus that subsequently aligns subordinate peripheral clocks with each other and with external time. Here we review new experiments using conditional mouse genetics suggesting that resetting of the circadian system occurs in a more ``federated'' and tissue-specific fashion, which allows for increased noise resistance and plasticity of circadian timekeeping under natural conditions.},

LEDs, as the main fraction in SSL, can theoretically convert the electrical energy by 100 \% to visible light. This paper introduces common lighting solutions and points out challenges for LED packaging. A detailed discussion will be done on heat dissipation, which is a significant factor regarding efficiency as well as life time. Standard and forward-looking materials and techniques will be introduced. Finally, the environmental impact of the SSL modules will be discussed. Even if the LEDs are more efficient than fluorescent lamps and need by total weight less material than incandescent lamps, the used materials are noble and rare, so a critical validation of their use is needed.},

Therefore, blocking blue light could create a form of physiologic darkness. Because the timing and quantity of light and darkness both affect sleep, evening use of amber lenses to block blue light might affect sleep quality. Mood is also affected by light and sleep; therefore, mood might be affected by blue light blockade. In this study, 20 adult volunteers were randomized to wear either blue-blocking (amber) or yellow-tinted (blocking ultraviolet only) safety glasses for 3 h prior to sleep. Participants completed sleep diaries during a one-week baseline assessment and two weeks' use of glasses. Outcome measures were subjective: change in overall sleep quality and positive/negative affect. Results demonstrated that sleep quality at study outset was poorer in the amber lens than the control group. Two- by three-way ANOVA revealed significant (p {$<$} .001) interaction between quality of sleep over the three weeks and experimental condition. At the end of the study, the amber lens group experienced significant (p {$<$} .001) improvement in sleep quality relative to the control group and positive affect (p = .005). Mood also improved significantly relative to controls. A replication with more detailed data on the subjects' circadian baseline and objective outcome measures is warranted.

However, it is difficult to acquire 3D face data in real-time since conventional 3D data acquisition systems like laser scanner or structured light system are very slow for the data capturing. Recently, Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera provides full range distance data at high framerates and thus comes into the spotlight as an alternative to conventional 3D acquisition systems. ToF camera provides both distance images and gray-scale images simultaneously in realtime. However, it has drawbacks which are low resolution and gray-scale image, not color image. In this paper, a registration method of color and ToF cameras is presented to find precise corresponding color pixel information with range distance data from ToF camera.},

  abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey ( n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

  abstract = {Objectives This systematic review concerns the role of nightshift work in the risk of breast cancer or other cancers. Methods Studies that specifically included information on nightshift or shift work and reported cancer occurrence were focused upon. A systematic search of Medline and the Science Citation Index was conducted until May 2007. The quality of each paper was discussed with respect to design, exposure and outcome information, bias, confounding, and exposure-response assessment. Results Thirteen relevant reports were found, and eight reported the relative risk for breast cancer, three for prostate cancer, three for colon cancer, and four for all cancers. Most of the studies had crude information about nightshift work, four register-linked studies had no individual exposure information but relied on exposure probabilities assessed on a group level, and no studies analyzed cancer risk according to the cumulative number of night shifts (however, most of the studies did so according to the number of years of nightshift work). Confounding did not seem to be of major concern. The presentation of the results was not always complete, and it would have been appreciated if the reasons for leaving some findings out had been reported. There were indications of a long-term effect of nightshift work (more than 20-30 years), but the number of positive studies was small. In addition, they were all conducted among nurses, and the risk estimates were only moderately increased. This situation makes the results sensitive to bias, chance, and confounding. Conclusions There is limited evidence for a causal association between nightshift work and breast cancer, while there is insufficient evidence for prostate cancer, colon cancer, and overall cancer.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Salivary melatonin levels were measured in 12 healthy volunteers in order to determine whether a moderate light intensity, which suppresses the nocturnal rise of melatonin, was able to shift the melatonin rhythm. The samples were collected at 1-hr intervals under lighting of {$<$} 100 lux (experiment 1) or {$<$} 10 lux (experiment 2). The control melatonin profiles were determined during the first night. In the second night the subjects were exposed to light of 500 lux for 60 min during the rising phase of melatonin synthesis. The third series of samples was collected during the third night. The mean decrease of melatonin levels by the exposure to light was 56\% of the prelight concentrations. The melatonin onset times were delayed significantly (about 30 min) the night after the exposure to light. The melatonin offset times tended to be delayed in experiment 2. The shifts of the melatonin offset correlated positively with the amount of the melatonin suppression. The results suggest that a relatively small and short lasting light-induced interruption of melatonin synthesis may affect the melatonin rhythm in humans.},

Arnold, in which two aircraft were equipped as tankers, each with a 50 ft length of hose, and a flight of 37 hr 15 min was achieved. Towards the end of that year the first serious attempt in Europe was made in France.There was then a lull until January 1929 when the US War Department sponsored some duration flights, the best known being that by the Fokker ``Question Mark'' under the command of Major (later General) Carl Spaatz which remained airborne for 150 hours. This flight was followed by a spate of US commercial pilots' attempts until in 1930 the endurance record stood at 647{$\frac{1}{2}$} hr. Most of these flights in themselves were of little practical value but they aroused the interest of Sqn. Ldr. (later Air Marshal Sir Richard) R. L. R. Atcherley, RAF while taking part in the National Air Races in the USA in 1930. On his return to Transjordan, where he was stationed, he set to work devising an improved method of contact, the results of which were patented. He also planned to demonstrate his new method with an attempt on the duration record but was refused permission by the Air Ministry.},

  abstract = {Artificial lighting systems are transitioning from incandescent to compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs in response to the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act and the EU Ecodesign Directive, which leads to energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Although CFLs and LEDs are more energy-efficient than incandescent bulbs, they require more metal-containing components. There is uncertainty about the potential environmental impacts of these components and whether special provisions must be made for their disposal at the end of useful life. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the resource depletion and toxicity potentials from the metals in incandescent, CFL, and LED bulbs to complement the development of sustainable energy policy. We assessed the potentials by examining whether the lighting products are to be categorized as hazardous waste under existing U.S. federal and California state regulations and by applying life cycle impact-based and hazard-based assessment methods (note that ``life cycle impact-based method'' does not mean a general life cycle assessment (LCA) but rather the elements in LCA used to quantify toxicity potentials). We discovered that both CFL and LED bulbs are categorized as hazardous, due to excessive levels of lead (Pb) leachability (132 and 44 mg/L, respectively; regulatory limit: 5) and the high contents of copper (111\,000 and 31\,600 mg/kg, respectively; limit: 2500), lead (3860 mg/kg for the CFL bulb; limit: 1000), and zinc (34\,500 mg/kg for the CFL bulb; limit: 5000), while the incandescent bulb is not hazardous (note that the results for CFL bulbs excluded mercury vapor not captured during sample preparation). The CFLs and LEDs have higher resource depletion and toxicity potentials than the incandescent bulb due primarily to their high aluminum, copper, gold, lead, silver, and zinc. Comparing the bulbs on an equivalent quantity basis with respect to the expected lifetimes of the bulbs, the CFLs and LEDs have 3\textendash 26 and 2\textendash 3 times higher potential impacts than the incandescent bulb, respectively. We conclude that in addition to enhancing energy efficiency, conservation and sustainability policies should focus on the development of technologies that reduce the content of hazardous and rare metals in lighting products without compromising their performance and useful lifespan.},

Evacuation path optimization has vital importance in reducing the human and social harm and saving the aid time. Significant research efforts have been made in the literature to deal with evacuation optimization on the basis of deterministic optimization model, nevertheless the stochastic aspects or uncertainty of real-world evacuation have not been taken into account comprehensively. Inspired by the promising performance of heuristic algorithms to solve combinatorial problems, this paper proposes an improved quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) for exhaustive optimization of the evacuation path that people can evacuate from hazardous areas to safe areas. In comparison with ACO (ant colony optimization) based method, QACA has the capability of finding a good solution faster using fewer individuals and possesses strong robustness, as a result of the quantum representation and updating of pheromone. Experiment results show that the proposed approach executes more effectively during evacuation.},

  abstract = {The endogenous circadian oscillator in mammals, situated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, receives environmental photic input from specialized subsets of photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells. The human circadian pacemaker is exquisitely sensitive to ocular light exposure, even in some people who are otherwise totally blind. The magnitude of the resetting response to white light depends on the timing, intensity, duration, number and pattern of exposures. We report here that the circadian resetting response in humans, as measured by the pineal melatonin rhythm, is also wavelength dependent. Exposure to 6.5 h of monochromatic light at 460 nm induces a two-fold greater circadian phase delay than 6.5 h of 555 nm monochromatic light of equal photon density. Similarly, 460 nm monochromatic light causes twice the amount of melatonin suppression compared to 555 nm monochromatic light, and is dependent on the duration of exposure in addition to wavelength. These studies demonstrate that the peak of sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to light is blue-shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system, the sensitivity of which peaks at {$\sim$}555 nm. Thus photopic lux, the standard unit of illuminance, is inappropriate when quantifying the photic drive required to reset the human circadian pacemaker.},

As compared with those exposed to 555-nm light, subjects exposed to 460-nm light had significantly lower subjective sleepiness ratings, decreased auditory reaction time, fewer attentional failures, decreased EEG power density in the delta-theta range (0.5\textendash 5.5 Hz), and increased EEG power density in the high-alpha range (9.5\textendash 10.5 Hz). Light had no direct effect on cortisol.Short-wavelength sensitivity to the acute alerting effects of light indicates that the visual photopic system is not the primary photoreceptor system mediating these responses to light. The frequency-specific changes in the waking EEG indicate that short-wavelength light is a powerful agent that immediately attenuates the negative effects of both homeostatic sleep pressure and the circadian drive for sleep on alertness, performance, and the ability to sustain attention.},

Ten SAD patients were randomly assigned to 40-min exposure to 10,000 lux white light or to 400 lux red light which served as placebo. Each patient received treatment for 8 days, and after a wash-out period was crossed over to the other treatment condition. Depression was assessed by the 21-item HDRS and SIGH-SAD by a blind rater and the patients completed the BDI for self-assessment. Significantly greater improvement was found with 10,000 lux treatment than with the placebo ( P = 0.011, P = 0.017 and P = 0.028 for SIGH-SAD, HDRS and BDI respectively). The 10,000 lux therapy improved the SIGH-SAD score by an average of 16.1 while the average improvement on placebo treatment was 5.0. The patients were rated again the following summer; most of them were then symptomless. Those patients who improved most on phototherapy also tended to improve most during the summer.},

  abstract = {Aims The ocular surface is the very first barrier between the visual system and external environment. It protects the eye from the exposure to various light sources that significantly emit in blue spectrum. However, the impact of blue light on the ocular surface has been poorly explored so far. In this study, we investigated in vitro the phototoxicity of blue light illumination in human epithelial cells of the ocular surface. We worked either in basal conditions or under hyperosmolar stress, in order to mimic dry eye disease (DED) that is the most common disease involving the ocular surface. Results Corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells suffered the most from violet-blue light but also from longer-wave blue light. Exposure to blue wavebands significantly decreased cellular viability, impacted on cellular morphology and provoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-production. Conjunctival epithelial cell line had a greater photosensitivity than the corneal epithelial one. Hyperosmolar stress potentiated the blue light phototoxicity, increasing inflammation, altering mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggering the glutathione-based antioxidant system. Innovation In human epithelial corneal and conjunctival cells of the ocular surface, we demonstrated the harmful impact of blue light on viability, redox state and inflammation processes, which was modified by hyperosmolarity. Conclusion Blue light induced cell death and significant ROS production, and altered the expression of inflammatory genes and operation of the cellular defensive system. We established for the first time that hyperosmolar stress impacted phototoxicity, further suggesting that DED patients might be more sensitive to blue light ocular toxicity.},

  abstract = {Students who work during the school year face the potential of sleep deprivation and its effects, since they have to juggle between school and work responsibilities along with social life. This may leave them with less time left for sleep than their nonworking counterparts. Chronotype is a factor that may exert an influence on the sleep of student workers. Also, light and social zeitgebers may have an impact on the sleep-related problems of this population. This study aimed to document sleep, light exposure patterns, social rhythms, and work-related fatigue of student workers aged 19\textendash 21 yrs and explore possible associations with chronotype. A total of 88 student workers (mean {$\pm$} SD: 20.18 {$\pm$} .44 yrs of age; 36 males/52 females) wore an actigraph (Actiwatch-L; Mini-Mitter/Respironics,Bend, OR) and filled out the Social Rhythm Metric for two consecutive weeks during the school year. Also, they completed the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion/Recovery Scale (OFER). Repeated and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), Pearson's chi-square tests, and correlation coefficients were used for statistical comparisons. Subjects slept an average of 06:28 h/night. Actigraphic sleep parameters, such as sleep duration, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep latency, did not differ between chronotypes. Results also show that evening types (n = 17) presented lower subjective sleep quality than intermediate types (n = 58) and morning types (n = 13). Moreover, evening types reported higher levels of chronic work-related fatigue, exhibited less regular social rhythms, and were exposed to lower levels of light during their waking hours (between 2 and 11 h after wake time) as compared to intermediate types and morning types. In addition, exposure to light intensities between 100 and 500 lux was lower in evening types than in intermediate types and morning types. However, bright light exposure ({$\geq$}1000 lux) did not differ between chronotypes. In conclusion, results suggest that student workers may constitute a high-risk population for sleep deprivation. Evening types seemed to cope less well with sleep deprivation, reporting poorer sleep quality and higher levels of work-related fatigue than intermediate types and morning types. The higher chronic work-related fatigue of evening types may be linked to their attenuated level of light exposure and weaker social zeitgebers. These results add credence to the hypothesis that eveningness entails a higher risk of health-impairing behaviors. (Author correspondence: luc.laberge@uqac.ca)},

Using the microlevel data of Japanese households, we identify the determinants of LED adoption. We take two approaches in the empirical analysis. In the first approach, we define the adoption stage of each household based on whether LEDs are installed in different types of rooms. We then analyze the relationship between the adoption stage and household characteristics based on the ordered logit model. In the second approach, we apply the item response theory method to assess the household's ability to adopt LEDs. We then analyze the relationship between household adaptability and characteristics based on the two-sided truncation model. We find that the impacts of household characteristics on LED adoption are similar between the two approaches: low-income households do not use LEDs; household heads aged 65 to 74 are active in LED installation, although those older than 75 are less active; people living in old or rented houses do not use LEDs. Finally, we find a large variation in LED installation across prefectures.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics--particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life--and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines.An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

  abstract = {The refinement process in genetic algorithms is carried out mainly by crossover and mutation operators. In their classical forms these operators need to be tuned through parameters and they are not efficient enough. Moreover, lack of sufficient variation in the population causes genetic algorithms to stagnate at local optima. In this work a new dynamic mutation operator called random building block operator with variable mutation rate proportionate to the number of variables in the problem is proposed. This operator does not require any pre-fixed parameter. At runtime it dynamically takes into account the length of the binary presentation of the individual and the number of variables in the problem and replaces a randomly selected section of the individual by a randomly generated bit string of the same size. Experimentation with 33 test functions, 231 test cases and 11550 test runs proved the superiority of the proposed dynamic mutation operator over single-point mutation operator with 1\%, 5\% and 8\% mutation rates and the multipoint mutation operator with 5\%, 8\% and 15\% mutation rates. Based on the experimentation results the random building block operator can be proposed as a better substitution of single-point and multipoint mutation operators.},

A common molecular mechanism underlies the cell-autonomous circadian oscillator throughout the body, yet this clock system is adapted to different functional contexts. In the central suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a coupled population of neuronal circadian oscillators acts as a master pacemaker for the organism to drive rhythms in activity and rest, feeding, body temperature, and hormones. Coupling within the SCN network confers robustness to the SCN pacemaker, which in turn provides stability to the overall temporal architecture of the organism. Throughout the majority of the cells in the body, cell-autonomous circadian clocks are intimately enmeshed within metabolic pathways. Thus, an emerging view for the adaptive significance of circadian clocks is their fundamental role in orchestrating metabolism.},

  abstract = {Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are no longer confined to use in commercial signage and have now moved firmly, and with unquestioned advantages, into the field of commercial and domestic lighting. This development was prompted in the late 1980s by the invention of the blue LED, a wavelength that had previously been missing from the available LED spectrum and which opened the way to providing white light. Since that point, LED performance (including energy efficiency) has improved dramatically, and now compares with the performance of fluorescent lights - and there remain further performance improvements yet to be delivered. The book begins with the principles of LED lighting, then focuses on issues and challenges. Chapters are devoted to key steps in LED manufacturing: substrate, epitaxy, process and packaging. Photoelectric characterization of LEDs, Lighting with LEDs and the imposition of a certain level of color quality, are the subject of later chapters, and finally there is a detailed discussion of the emergence of OLEDs, or organic LEDs, which have specific capabilities of immediate interest and importance in this field.},

  abstract = {To determine the characteristics of the damages of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors of pigmented mice induced by exposure to blue light emitting diode (LED) light, and to determine the mechanisms causing the damages. Exposure to blue LED light for 3 days induced retinal damage, and the characteristics of the damage differed from that induced by white fluorescent light exposure. Ophthalmoscopy showed that blue LED exposure for 3 days induced white spots on the retina, and histological examinations showed materials accumulated at the IS/OS junction of the photoreceptors. The accumulated materials were stained by ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1), a marker for macrophages. The debris was also positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). An enlarging the area of RPE was detected just after the blue LED exposure especially around the optic nerve, and this led to a secondary degeneration of the photoreceptors. Exposure of pigmented mice to 3 consecutive days of blue LED light will cause RPE and photoreceptor damage. The damage led to an accumulation of macrophages and drusen-like materials around the outer segments of the photoreceptors. This blue light exposed model may be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of non-exudative age-related macular degeneration.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Circadian rhythmicity impairment reportedly becomes significant as a tumor progresses, while the incidence of cancer can be affected by disruption of the circadian system. Melatonin has oncostatic effects on several types of cancer (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers), while it can be self-defeating in others, such as lymphoma. Melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers in humans; however, it seems to respond positively to melatonin in vitro. The present work tested whether body temperature (BT) rhythms are impaired by tumor progression, and whether exogenous melatonin restricts tumor growth and restores circadian rhythmicity; therefore, enhancing survival. To this end, C57 mice were intraperitoneal implanted with a temperature data logger and subcutaneously inoculated with melanoma cells. Animals were then submitted to light\textendash dark (LD) 12:12 cycles or continuous light (LL), with or without melatonin administration. Under LD light conditions, the BT rhythm exhibited a marked reduction in the first circadian harmonic amplitude, and increased phase instability (Rayleigh vector) as the tumor progressed. Melatonin administration (2 mg/kg BW/day), on the other hand, increased the BT rhythm amplitude and phase stability, reduced tumor weight and prevented intraperitoneal dissemination. Exposure to LL induced a free-running rhythm (1500 min), significantly increasing tumor malignity, and therefore reducing survival. Surprisingly, the highest tumor weights and morbidity by metastasis were seen in the LL group treated with melatonin probably because this indoleamine was being administered at different subjective hours to free-running animals. Circadian rhythmicity can thus be used as a marker rhythm for tumor progression, as rhythm impairment increases along with tumor malignancy. While melatonin administration improves rhythmicity and enhances survival under LD conditions, the results are self-defeating when they coexist with circadian disruption as it occurs under LL. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account endogenous rhythmicity and limiting melatonin administration to the subjective night in order to restrict melanoma progression.},

Individual sensitivity to such suppression is variable, and the factors determining such sensitivity are largely unknown. By analogy with animal work previous short or long-term exposure to different light intensities may be an important determinant. We exploited the Antarctic environment to investigate these possibilities. Groups of healthy men, living on the British Antarctic Survey Base at Halley (75\textdegree{} South) were exposed to dim (range 290\textendash 310 lux) and bright (range 2100\textendash 2300 lux) light either from 01.00\textendash 02.00 h or 05.00\textendash 0.600 h, both in winter and in summer. Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay in serial blood samples taken before, during and after light treatment, and in control (darkness) conditions. Light suppression of melatonin was more effective in the latter part of the night in winter and this was particularly well-differentiated for dim light.},

Circadian rhythm disruption by shift work is associated with greater risk for cancer development and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeostasis. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the effects of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that both physiologic perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the central circadian clock components decreased survival and promoted lung tumor growth and progression. The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were shown to have cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive roles in transformation and lung tumor progression. Loss of the central clock components led to increased c-Myc expression, enhanced proliferation, and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic and somatic disruption of circadian rhythms contribute to cancer progression.},

The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20\% and 40\% in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50\% of building consumption and 20\% of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of offices is analysed in deeper detail.},

That is, unlike other approaches such as computational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations are used and no model assumptions are made. However, the representation used significantly restricted the range of morphologies explored. In this paper, we present initial explorations into the use of a simple generative encoding, known as Gielis superformula, that produces a highly flexible 3D shape representation to design VAWT. First, the target-based evolution of 3D artefacts is investigated and subsequently initial design experiments are performed wherein each VAWT candidate is physically instantiated and evaluated under fan generated wind conditions. It is shown possible to produce very closely matching designs of a number of 3D objects through the evolution of supershapes produced by Gielis superformula. Moreover, it is shown possible to use artificial physical evolution to identify novel and increasingly efficient supershape VAWT designs.},

The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates the presence of a long cytoplasmic tail with multiple putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this opsin's function may be finely regulated. Melanopsin mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic sites thought to contain deep brain photoreceptors and in the iris, a structure known to be directly photosensitive in amphibians. Melanopsin message is also localized in retinal cells residing in the outermost lamina of the inner nuclear layer where horizontal cells are typically found. Its expression in retinal and nonretinal tissues suggests a role in vision and nonvisual photoreceptive tasks, such as photic control of skin pigmentation, pupillary aperture, and circadian and photoperiodic physiology.},

To support QoS, the link state information such as delay, bandwidth, jitter, cost, error rate and node energy in the network should be available and manageable. The focus of this paper is extending the scope to QoS routing procedure, to inform the source about QoS available to any destination in the wireless network. However, existing QoS routing solutions were dealt with only one or two of the QoS parameters. It is important that MANETs should provide QoS support routing, such as acceptable delay, jitter and energy in the case of multimedia and real time applications. This paper proposes a QoS Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) called Ant DSR (ADSR).The performance of DSR and ADSR are analyzed using network simulator-2. ADSR produces better results than the existing DSR in terms of delay, energy, jitter and throughput.},

The circadian clock can be divided into 2 parts: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which receives light cues, and the peripheral clocks that reside in various tissues throughout the body. The peripheral clocks play an integral and unique role in each of their respective tissues, driving the circadian expression of specific genes involved in a variety of physiological functions. The goal of this review is to provide an introduction to and overview of the peripheral clocks, including potential mechanisms, targets, and implications for disease states.

  abstract = {Dynamic analysis and control system design for aerial refueling hose-drogue systems during a receiver-probe coupling phase are studied. When a receiver plane approaches to couple with a refueling drogue, the hose-drogue system undergoes transient motion due to the receiver fore-body aerodynamic effect in addition to the tanker motion and downwash, and atmospheric turbulence. At the moment of contact with the drogue, the drag force on the drogue drops resulting in erratic motion of the refueling hose due to loss of tension. Unless carefully regulated, this may lead to critical damages to the refueling assembly and the receiver probe. In this paper, a hose-drogue dynamic model previously developed by the authors is extended to study 1) the receiver fore-body aerodynamic effect on the drogue transient motion prior to coupling, 2) the wave motion of the drogue-hose system due to the tension change in the hose, and 3) some possible active control strategies for the hose-drogue system during the pre- and the post- contact with the receiver probe.

In one hundred lean and incisive statements, he argues that we are essentially social creatures, and that we achieve our greatest aspirations when we work together\textemdash not as individuals. Yet today society is threatened by a vast antihuman infrastructure that undermines our ability to connect.

Team Human delivers a call to arms. If we are to resist and survive these destructive forces, we must recognize that being human is a team sport. In Rushkoff's own words: ``Being social may be the whole point.'' Harnessing wide-ranging research on human evolution, biology, and psychology, Rushkoff shows that when we work together we realize greater happiness, productivity, and peace.

  abstract = {During the last 20 years, numerous clinical trials have examined the therapeutic usefulness of melatonin in different fields of medicine. The objective of this article is to review, in depth, the science regarding clinical trials performed to date. The efficacy of melatonin has been assessed as a treatment of ocular diseases, blood diseases, gastrointestinal tract diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, infectious diseases, neurological diseases, sleep disturbances, aging and depression. Melatonin has been also used as a complementary treatment in anaesthesia, hemodialysis, in vitro fertilization and neonatal care. The conclusion of the current review is that the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapy seems to be well founded for macular degeneration, glaucoma, protection of the gastric mucosa, irritable bowel syndrome, arterial hypertension, diabetes, side effects of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer patients or hemodialysis in patients with renal insufficiency and, especially, for sleep disorders of circadian etiology (jet lag, delayed sleep phase syndrome, sleep deterioration associated with aging, etc.) as well as in those related with neurological degenerative diseases (Alzheimer, etc.,) or Smith-Magenis syndrome. The utility of melatonin in anesthetic procedures has been also confirmed. More clinical studies are required to clarify whether, as the preliminary data suggest, melatonin is useful for treatment of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, infectious diseases, neoplasias or neonatal care. Preliminary data regarding the utility of melatonin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis are either ambiguous or negative. Although in a few cases melatonin seems to aggravate some conditions, the vast majority of studies document the very low toxicity of melatonin over a wide range of doses.},

This paper presents a detailed and in-depth comparison between both devices. In order to conduct the comparison, we propose a framework of seven different experimental setups, which is a generic basis for evaluating range cameras such as Kinect. The experiments have been designed with the goal to capture individual effects of the Kinect devices as isolatedly as possible and in a way, that they can also be adopted, in order to apply them to any other range sensing device. The overall goal of this paper is to provide a solid insight into the pros and cons of either device. Thus, scientists who are interested in using Kinect range sensing cameras in their specific application scenario can directly assess the expected, specific benefits and potential problem of either device.},

Some evidence suggests an association between night work and breast cancer risk, possibly through the melatonin pathway.         Methods:~         In a cohort of premenopausal nurses, we prospectively studied the relation between rotating night shift work and breast cancer risk. Total number of months during which the nurses worked rotating night shifts was first assessed at baseline in 1989 and periodically updated thereafter. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).         Results:~         Among 115,022 women without cancer at baseline, 1,352 developed invasive breast cancer during 12 years of follow up. Women who reported more than 20 years of rotating night shift work experienced an elevated relative risk of breast cancer compared with women who did not report any rotating night shift work (multivariate RR = 1.79; 95\% CI = 1.06\textendash 3.01). There was no increase in risk associated with fewer years of rotating night work.         Conclusion:~         Our results suggest a modestly elevated risk of breast cancer after longer periods of rotating night work. Additional studies are warranted to rule out small sample size or uncontrolled sources for confounding as alternative explanations.},

We postulate a hierarchy of effect of environmental elements ranging from simply nontoxic to safe (both physically and psychologically) to "providing a positive context" to being actively salutogenic. Most relevant research has been concentrated on a limited number of settings and is inadequate to inform the creation of design guidelines for the physical elements of an optimal healing environment. Opportunities exist to make meaningful contributions in this area that are likely to make a significant impact on health outcomes of human beings.},

  abstract = {In recent years, LED lighting became an indispensable alternative to conventional lighting systems. Sophisticated solutions offer not only comfortable white light with a good color rendering. They also provide the possibility of changing illuminance and color temperature. Some systems even simulate daylight over the entire day, some including natural variations as due to clouds. Such systems are supposed to support the chronobiological needs of human and to have a positive effect on well-being, performance, sleep-quality and health. Lighting can also be used to support specific aims in a situation, like to improve productivity in activation or to support recreation in relaxation. Research regarding suitable light-settings for such situations and superordinate questions like their influence on well-being and health is still incomplete. We investigated the subjective preferences of men and women regarding light-settings for activation and relaxation. We supplied two rooms and four cubes with light sources that provide the possibility of tuning illuminance, color temperature and deviation from Plackian locus. More than 80 individuals \textendash{} belonging to four groups differing in gender and age \textendash{} were asked to imagine activating and recovering situations for which they should adjust suitable and pleasant lighting by tuning the above mentioned light properties. It was shown that there are clear differences in the lighting conditions preferred for these two situations. Also some combined gender- and age-specific differences became apparent.},

  abstract = {Objective:Patients with bipolar disorder have recurrent major depression, residual mood symptoms, and limited treatment options. Building on promising pilot data, the authors conducted a 6-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive bright light therapy at midday for bipolar depression. The aims were to determine remission rate, depression symptom level, and rate of mood polarity switch, as well as to explore sleep quality.Method:The study enrolled depressed adults with bipolar I or II disorder who were receiving stable dosages of antimanic medication (excluding patients with hypomania or mania, mixed symptoms, or rapid cycling). Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either 7,000-lux bright white light or 50-lux dim red placebo light (N=23 for each group). Symptoms were assessed weekly with the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale With Atypical Depression Supplement (SIGH-ADS), the Mania Rating Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Remission was defined as having a SIGH-ADS score of 8 or less.Results:At baseline, both groups had moderate depression and no hypomanic or manic symptoms. Compared with the placebo light group, the group treated with bright white light experienced a significantly higher remission rate (68.2\% compared with 22.2\%; adjusted odds ratio=12.6) at weeks 4\textendash 6 and significantly lower depression scores (9.2 [SD=6.6] compared with 14.9 [SD=9.2]; adjusted {$\beta$}=\textendash 5.91) at the endpoint visit. No mood polarity switches were observed. Sleep quality improved in both groups and did not differ significantly between them.Conclusions:The data from this study provide robust evidence that supports the efficacy of midday bright light therapy for bipolar depression.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To perform a dose-ranging safety and efficacy study of bright light therapy for depression in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Nine women with DSM-IV BD I or II in the depressed phase were exposed to 50 lux (illuminance at the receiving surface) red light for two weeks, after which they received 7,000 lux light therapy for two-week epochs of 15, 30 and 45 min daily. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement and the Mania Rating Scale were used to assess mood symptoms. Four patients received morning light and five patients received midday light. Results: Three of the four subjects treated with morning light developed mixed states. The fourth subject achieved a full, sustained response. To decrease the risk of inducing mixed episodes, we changed the time of light exposure to midday. Of the five women who received midday light therapy, two achieved full response and two showed early improvement but required a dose increase to sustain response. One woman remained depressed with 45 min of midday light but responded fully to a switch to morning light, 30 min daily. Conclusions: Women with bipolar illness are highly sensitive to morning bright light treatment; the induction of mixed states is a substantial risk. Initiating treatment with a brief duration (15 min) of midday light for bipolar depression is advisable.},

Limitations in current methods are described, together with the potential benefits of applying PS and the particular need for a new dynamic form of the method. Important issues relating to conventional idealised PS model assumptions are considered in the context of realising useful practical application, including in particular the modelling of real illuminates. Several possible techniques for achieving dynamic PS are considered and a new technique termed narrow infrared photometric stereo (NIRPS) introduced. New potential application areas range from the continuous inspection of fast moving surfaces typically encountered in numerous industrial processes to three-dimensional surface topographic texture acquisition in the field using portable hand-held technology. A selection of experimental results is presented in the paper.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, and there is only a limited explanation of why. Risk is highest in the most industrialized countries but also is rising rapidly in the developing world. Known risk factors account for only a portion of the incidence in the high-risk populations, and there has been considerable speculation and many false leads on other possibly major determinants of risk, such as dietary fat. A hallmark of industrialization is the increasing use of electricity to light the night, both within the home and without. It has only recently become clear that this evolutionarily new and, thereby, unnatural exposure can disrupt human circadian rhythmicity, of which three salient features are melatonin production, sleep, and the circadian clock. A convergence of research in cells, rodents, and humans suggests that the health consequences of circadian disruption may be substantial. An innovative experimental model has shown that light at night markedly increases the growth of human breast cancer xenografts in rats. In humans, the theory that light exposure at night increases breast cancer risk leads to specific predictions that are being tested epidemiologically: evidence has accumulated on risk in shift workers, risk in blind women, and the impact of sleep duration on risk. If electric light at night does explain a portion of the breast cancer burden, then there are practical interventions that can be implemented, including more selective use of light and the adoption of recent advances in lighting technology and application.

Face recognition has been a topic of active research since the 1980's, proposing solutions to several practical problems. Face recognition is probably the biometric method that is used to identify people mainly from their faces. However, the recognition process used by the human brain for identifying faces is very challenging. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed for face recognition. The proposed algorithm recognizes an unknown image by comparing it with the known training images stored in the database and gives information regarding the person recognized. The proposed algorithm is then compared with other known face recognition algorithms viz: Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) algorithms. It has been observed that the recognition rate of the proposed algorithm is better.},

The results of this study are as follows. 1) Desirable lighting environment for working and talking is active atmosphere. 2) Lighting environment desirable far relaxation is to heighten lighting contrast using candescent lamps and local lights. In other words, active atmosphere, which is desirable for working and talking, is not desirable for relaxation. 3) Lighting for working requires bright illuminance and high color temperature(6000k). 4) Lighting for relaxation requires somewhat low brightness regardless of color temperature. If the light is bright it is better to use lamps of low color temperature. 5) for conversation, bright illuminance is more desirable than dark one, and the most adequate color temperature is 4000K.},

Detailed molecular phylogenetic analyses show that the opsin family is divided into seven subfamilies, which correspond well to functional classifications within the family: the vertebrate visual (transducin-coupled) and non-visual opsin subfamily, the encephalopsin/tmt-opsin subfamily, the Gq-coupled opsin/melanopsin subfamily, the Go-coupled opsin subfamily, the neuropsin subfamily, the peropsin subfamily and the retinal photoisomerase subfamily. The subfamilies diversified before the deuterostomes (including vertebrates) split from the protostomes (most invertebrates), suggesting that a common animal ancestor had multiple opsin genes. Opsins have a seven-transmembrane structure similar to that of other GPCRs, but are distinguished by a lysine residue that is a retinal-binding site in the seventh helix. Accumulated evidence suggests that most opsins act as pigments that activate G proteins in a light-dependent manner in both visual and non-visual systems, whereas a few serve as retinal photoisomerases, generating the chromophore used by other opsins, and some opsins have unknown functions.},

  abstract = {1 Non-image forming, irradiance-dependent responses mediated by the human eye include synchronisation of the circadian axis and suppression of pineal melatonin production. The retinal photopigment(s) transducing these light responses in humans have not been characterised. 2 Using the ability of light to suppress nocturnal melatonin production, we aimed to investigate its spectral sensitivity and produce an action spectrum. Melatonin suppression was quantified in 22 volunteers in 215 light exposure trials using monochromatic light (30 min pulse administered at circadian time (CT) 16-18) of different wavelengths ({$\lambda$}max 424, 456, 472, 496, 520 and 548 nm) and irradiances (0.7-65.0 {$\mu$}W cm-2). 3 At each wavelength, suppression of plasma melatonin increased with increasing irradiance. Irradiance-response curves (IRCs) were fitted and the generated half-maximal responses (IR50) were corrected for lens filtering and used to construct an action spectrum. 4 The resulting action spectrum showed unique short-wavelength sensitivity very different from the classical scotopic and photopic visual systems. The lack of fit (r2 {$<$} 0.1) of our action spectrum with the published rod and cone absorption spectra precluded these photoreceptors from having a major role. Cryptochromes 1 and 2 also had a poor fit to the data. Fitting a series of Dartnall nomograms generated for rhodopsin-based photopigments over the {$\lambda$}max range 420-480 nm showed that rhodopsin templates between {$\lambda$}max 457 and 462 nm fitted the data well (r2{$\geq$} 0.73). Of these, the best fit was to the rhodopsin template with {$\lambda$}max 459 nm (r2= 0.74). 5 Our data strongly support a primary role for a novel short-wavelength photopigment in light-induced melatonin suppression and provide the first direct evidence of a non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive system in humans.},

  abstract = {Evolution through natural selection has been going on for a very long time. Evolution through artificial selection has been practiced by humans for a large part of our history, in the breeding of plants and livestock. Artificial evolution, where we evolve an artifact through artificial selection, has been around since electronic computers became common: about 30 years. Right from the beginning, people have suggested using artificial evolution to design electronics automatically.l Only recently, though, have suitable re configurable silicon chips become available that make it easy for artificial evolution to work with a real, physical, electronic medium: before them, ex periments had to be done entirely in software simulations. Early research concentrated on the potential applications opened-up by the raw speed ad vantage of dedicated digital hardware over software simulation on a general purpose computer. This book is an attempt to show that there is more to it than that. In fact, a radically new viewpoint is possible, with fascinating consequences. This book was written as a doctoral thesis, submitted in September 1996. As such, it was a rather daring exercise in ruthless brevity. Believing that the contribution I had to make was essentially a simple one, I resisted being drawn into peripheral discussions. In the places where I deliberately drop a subject, this implies neither that it's not interesting, nor that it's not relevant: just that it's not a crucial part of the tale I want to tell here.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a blue light and ultraviolet cut-off filter (blue filter) could reduce short-wavelength retina/RPE damage threshold by a continuous spectrum source. Sixteen normal eyes of two rhesus monkeys and six cynomolgus monkeys were subjected to macular irradiation of 20, 24, 27.4, 30, 35, 45, 50 and 60~J/cm2 energy densities. The values of energy density were measured before the blue filter. Lesions were measured before and at 2 and 30 days after irradiation of a 2.8~mm diameter region within the macular arcade. Measures were fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography and long wavelength scanning by the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT) unit. The lesions, which were produced, were scored and compared to irradiant energy density of the blue LED (NSPB500S, Nichia, Tokushima, Japan). The exposure at the 20~J/cm2 produced no detectable result at 2 or 30 days. Exposure at 35~J/cm2 showed definite lesion production without blue filter. With the filter added there was one indication of minor change. At 60~J/cm2 there was extensive heavy, enduring damage without the filter and with the filter damage was present but was significantly attenuated. These results strongly support the conclusion that the blue filter attenuation reduces the frequency of damage by exposure. This experimental system is a useful model for normal human eye aging and continuous spectrum environment irradiance.},

The problems of slow and premature convergence to suboptimal solution remain an existing struggle that GA is facing. Due to lower diversity in a population, it becomes challenging to locally exploit the solutions. In order to resolve these issues, the focus is now on reaching equilibrium between the explorative and exploitative features of GA. Therefore, the search process can be prompted to produce suitable GA solutions. This paper begins with an introduction, Section 2 describes the GA exploration and exploitation strategies to locate the optimum solutions. Section 3 and 4 present the lists of some prevalent mutation and crossover operators. This paper concludes that the key issue in developing a GA is to deliver a balance between explorative and exploitative features that complies with the combination of operators in order to produce exceptional performance as a GA as a whole.},

  abstract = {Light is a powerful modulator of cognition through its long-term effects on circadian rhythmicity and direct effects on brain function as identified by neuroimaging. How the direct impact of light on brain function varies with wavelength of light, circadian phase, and sleep homeostasis, and how this differs between individuals, is a largely unexplored area. Using functional MRI, we compared the effects of 1 minute of low-intensity blue (473 nm) and green light (527 nm) exposures on brain responses to an auditory working memory task while varying circadian phase and status of the sleep homeostat. Data were collected in 27 subjects genotyped for the PER3 VNTR (12 PER35/5 and 15 PER34/4) in whom it was previously shown that the brain responses to this task, when conducted in darkness, depend on circadian phase, sleep homeostasis, and genotype. In the morning after sleep, blue light, relative to green light, increased brain responses primarily in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the intraparietal sulcus, but only in PER34/4 individuals. By contrast, in the morning after sleep loss, blue light increased brain responses in a left thalamofrontoparietal circuit to a larger extent than green light, and only so in PER35/5 individuals. In the evening wake maintenance zone following a normal waking day, no differential effect of 1 minute of blue versus green light was observed in either genotype. Comparison of the current results with the findings observed in darkness indicates that light acts as an activating agent particularly under those circumstances in which and in those individuals in whom brain function is jeopardized by an adverse circadian phase and high homeostatic sleep pressure.},

Under full spectrum lamps they were given one of three instruction sets: `Full spectrum lamps improve performance and decrease fatigue' (positive set); `There is no evidence to support such claims' (negative set); or neutral information about light. The participants in the cool white condition received only the neutral information set.

The circadian clock has so eagerly spilled her secrets that we may soon know the unbroken chain of events from gene to behaviour.

By culturing cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode arrays, we have been able to record spontaneous action potentials from individual SCN neurons for days or weeks, revealing prominent circadian rhythms in firing rate. Despite abundant functional synapses, circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture are not synchronized. After reversible blockade of neuronal firing lasting 2.5 days, circadian firing rhythms re-emerge with unaltered phases. These data suggest that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators, and that synapses formed in vitro are neither necessary for operation of these oscillators nor sufficient for synchronizing them.},

As social influence can be maximized for many purposes, such as marketing, politics, spreading innovations, there are many stakeholders interested in progress in this area. As it has been shown, for most settings finding an optimal seed set is an NP-hard problem, this is why various heuristics started to emerge since the statement of the problem. In this work, we explore the applicability of evolutionary algorithm for influence maximization. The experiments conducted using real and artificial social networks and the linear threshold influence model show that this approach offers not only speed and accuracy. Also, some other interesting features have been found, such as the transferability of its parameters to other datasets. Summarizing the results, it was observed that the evolutionary algorithm does not lose its performance when limiting its time by the factor of two and for most datasets, we obtained a high correlation of ranked parameters' sets used for the evolutionary algorithm, typically around 0.9.

  abstract = {The advent of `DeepFake' content that is increasingly difficult for humans and machines to distinguish as artificial portends a number of challenges to democratic societies. In order to effectively respond, policymakers must gain understanding of how DeepFake content might manifest. This paper aims to offer necessary context by exploring AI-enabled multimedia disinformation across different levels: (1) as a mass-produced, regular feature of the information environment in democracies and (2) as a highly tailored instrument used in tandem with cyber operations. I explore the impact of DeepFakes on the ability of populations to determine the origination, credibility, quality and freedom of information. Such macro impacts amplify the potential value of DeepFake content employed alongside targeted cyber activities, a combination that even alone offers belligerent actors new opportunities for enhancing attempts at disinformation and coercion. Nevertheless, I ultimately argue that DeepFakes should be thought of more as an evolution than a revolution in disinformation techniques, the real threat of which emerges from the manner in which new abilities to produce even reasonable fidelity fabrications rapidly and at scale combine the multiform shape of the modern digital information environment to make organized influence efforts much more dynamic than has previously been the case.},

  abstract = {Overviewed are recent results of a new general approach to image understanding and computer vision utilizing the sensing of polarization of light. Whereas human vision is oblivious to components of light polarization, polarization parameters of light are shown to provide an important visual extension to intensity and color significantly expanding the application potential for image understanding. A physical state of polarization can be visualized directly in human terms as a particular hue and saturation, and this paper utilizes such a scheme presenting images of ordinary scenes as never seen before by humans in the domain of polarization vision. Metaphorically, humans are `color blind' with respect to the perception of polarization, and even though this does not appear to inhibit human visual performance, we show how polarization vision is a sensory augmentation that can significantly enhance both automated image understanding and even possibly improve human visual performance itself under certain conditions. Sensors, calledpolarization cameras, have been developed that automatically sense components of partial linear polarization and computationally process these components to produce polarization images. Prototypes of different polarization camera sensors have been presented in earlier literature. A recent advancement in the design of polarization cameras has made it possible to interface low-cost modular components with almost any existing imaging device converting it into an automatic polarization camera. This compatibility with small portable imaging devices is making polarization imaging for the first time accessible to a number of application areas outside the laboratory, both outdoors and underwater, revealing polarization vision as a vast new visually augmented domain with unique capabilities. This paper presents various results from three on-going field applications: natural object recognition, inspection of ship hulls for damage, and marine biology.},

Unlike both genetic and hill climbing algorithms, dynamic hill climbing has the ability to dynamically change its coordinate frame during the course of an optimization. Furthermore, the algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate and uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space. Dynamic hill climbing is empirically compared to a traditional genetic algorithm using De Jong's well-known five function test suite [4] and is shown to vastly surpass the performance of the genetic algorithm, often finding better solutions using only 1\% as many function evaluations. 1 Introduction Genetic algorithms [13, 10] have been applied to a wide variety of optimization problems ranging from the traveling salesman problem [12, 16] to ...},

  abstract = {1 Ocular exposure to early morning room light can significantly advance the timing of the human circadian pacemaker. The resetting response to such light has a non-linear relationship to illuminance. The dose-response relationship of the human circadian pacemaker to late evening light of dim to moderate intensity has not been well established. 2 Twenty-three healthy young male and female volunteers took part in a 9 day protocol in which a single experimental light exposure6.5 h in duration was given in the early biological night. The effects of the light exposure on the endogenous circadian phase of the melatonin rhythm and the acute effects of the light exposure on plasma melatonin concentration were calculated. 3 We demonstrate that humans are highly responsive to the phase-delaying effects of light during the early biological night and that both the phase resetting response to light and the acute suppressive effects of light on plasma melatonin follow a logistic dose-response curve, as do many circadian responses to light in mammals. 4 Contrary to expectations, we found that half of the maximal phase-delaying response achieved in response to a single episode of evening bright light ({$\approx$}9000 lux (lx)) can be obtained with just over 1 \% of this light (dim room light of {$\approx$}100 lx). The same held true for the acute suppressive effects of light on plasma melatonin concentrations. This indicates that even small changes in ordinary light exposure during the late evening hours can significantly affect both plasma melatonin concentrations and the entrained phase of the human circadian pacemaker.},
